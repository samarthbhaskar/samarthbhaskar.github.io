Sometimes, when I read something that's too close to my work life, I can't quite enjoy it. Reading and watching movies are among the few things I can do with my time that allows me to think about new things, different from my day to day life. For example, I recently watched Olivier Assayas's <em><a href="https://letterboxd.com/samarthbhaskar/film/non-fiction/">Non Fiction</a></em>, which has the digital transition of media as a tertiary plot point, and it was a bit triggering. 

Leave it to Colson Whitehead to write about the world of modern media and journalism and nail it, both as a description of what its like inside and commentary on how it fits into society. 

After a summer of reading a number of Colson Whitehead's books, I would say this ranks at the top so far, if not at number 1. It is funny, thoughtful, full of narrative and literary risks, and a intellectually rewarding story. I love the experience of knowing I'm in the hands of master story teller. And Whitehead pulls that off here maybe better than any of his other books.
