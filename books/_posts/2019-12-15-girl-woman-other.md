I learned of this book after it jointly won the Booker Prize earlier this year. In this case, the award did the commendable job of alerting a wider readership about this book than might have otherwise known about it. 

The experience of reading this book was particularly interesting in the age of Twitter. The internet can feel like a disjointed, context-less place, where I'm dipping in and out of people's lives, their opinions, news events, pictures, posts, and all sorts of things. This book expanded on that feeling in a deeper way. Reading about the lives of these twelve people, how they traverse modern day Europe and America and how they shape their lives (and how their lives are shaped by who they are) awarded me the kind of thing that the best of literature promises: the ability to live life as someone other than me for a little while.

The internet, at its best, sometimes delivers on that promise, too. But to wade through its cacophony is often a higher price than is worth paying.
