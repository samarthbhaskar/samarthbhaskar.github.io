The "ceci n'est pas un pipe" of post-modern novels. Leyner's novel is a short, mind bending, funny, sexy read. I enjoyed it while it was happening, I'm not sure exactly why. I was bummed when it was over, again not really sure why. I have a feeling it'll be a book I'll think about in the future, still unsure why it stuck with me.
