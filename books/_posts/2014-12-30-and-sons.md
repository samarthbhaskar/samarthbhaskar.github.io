It's too bad this book is so easy to read, because you might end up reading all of it and then realize it wasn't really that impressive at all. It's about white men, engaging in self-congratulatory work, dealing with self-involved problems and never looking outside their own world. I love New York, I love reading books about New York, however this book is about a New York I don't know (Park Ave, Upper East/West, Exeter, literary galas, reclusive authors) and I don't really care to know. I'd much rather read about the New York Zadie Smith, James Baldwin, Teju Cole or even Woody Allen talk about.
