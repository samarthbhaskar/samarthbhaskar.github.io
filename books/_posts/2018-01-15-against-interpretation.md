Susan Sontag has been on my radar for a while, whether through references in literature and journalism I've been reading, or because people like AO Scott refer to her frequently in their own criticism. Her political pedigree, and role in the feminism movement is also something I've come across a few times.

This was my first experience with her writing and I came away largely impressed. She was an adept cultural commentator, a sharp writer and a consummate critic. Sontag's ability to craft arguments, grounded in cultural evidence, but write in a literary and erudite voice is worthy of envy for anyone trying to engage with art and society through writing. 

"Against Interpretation", "On Style" and "Notes on Camp" were my runaway favorites from this collection.
