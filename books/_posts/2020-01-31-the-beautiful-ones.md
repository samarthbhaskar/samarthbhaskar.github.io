This was an odd little book. Arguably, like all of Prince's work, Prince (even post-humously) was in control, wanted to break convention and keep his audience guessing. This "memoir" brought up more questions for me than it answered and I'd still love to learn, fully, some day how a young, black man from Minnesota gained more confidence than anyone else in the world. I look forward to reading that book someday.
