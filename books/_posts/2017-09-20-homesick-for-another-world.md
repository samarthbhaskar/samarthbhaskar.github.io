Ottessa Moshfegh's debut novel <em>Eileen</em> was one of my favorite books of 2015. I loved the peculiar characters at its center. I loved the world it described, the relationships it captured with coldness and distance, and the unlikability of its central character who is as compelling as the male anti-heroes we hate-but-love like Walter White, Don Draper and others. So when I ran across this collection of short stories, I was excited to dive in.

Thankfully, the collection did not dissapoint. Each story features some unsavory, complicated, noir character. The events of each story are not complex or overly romantic. However the simplicity belies something deeper, a world view that's internally consistent throughout Moshfeg's writing. She has a deeply weird view of life. One that I may not share, at least not 100 percent, but one that I find compelling and love getting lost in.

I'm excited for more from Moshfeg in coming years.
