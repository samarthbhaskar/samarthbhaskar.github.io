As James Woods from the <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2012/02/27/noble-savages">New Yorker</a> said, "[o]n every page of St. Aubynâ€™s work is a sentence or a paragraph that prompts a laugh, or a moment of enriched comprehension." This is the kind of writing that sustains this second novella in the Patrick Melrose series. Through drug addled nights, misanthropic friendly and romantic encounters, phone calls and dark trots around Manhattan, I stuck with St. Aubyn's Patrick Melrose not because I'm particularly interested in narratives about millionaire bad boys and their descriptions of addiction and abuse but because St. Aubyn's writing is just that good. This book wasn't better than <em><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2057967540">Never Mind</a></em> but it was another step in the journey through Melrose's life, and I'm on board for the next step.
