Suicide is a difficult subject but unceasingly interesting, to me. In a world of some certain outcomes (like death and loss), we knowingly plod along, every day, choosing to live. Until some of us don't. In the hands of this author, this subject becomes a premise upon which to explore -- through humor, a deep defense of family, of sibling relationships and the development of some incredible characters -- basically everything about life and death. 

I didn't know much about this book before picking it up, just that it was among some critics' best books of the decade. It will resonate, for me, as one of the best I read this year.
