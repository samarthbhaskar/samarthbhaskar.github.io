A gripping book that reminds us, despite itself at times, that the true heroes of these stories are the women who worked through a broken system that they had no reason to trust to come out and tell the truth. I don't think this is the case yet, but I hope we don't get to a point in relation to #metoo where the most important stories become the ones about journalists or lawyers doing their job, rather than about what the women suffered.

I read Chanel Miller's "Know My Name" right after this book and the contrast could not have been more stark. There's a place for both stories, but I wonder how many more people are content with reading a "spy thriller" replete with big names, corporate bad behavior, and institutions like NBC News and The New Yorker at its center. Rather than the story of the harrowing 3-years of torture a victim of sexual assault went through after the actions of her perpetrator one night. I hope there's more room for stories like that along the way, too.

Anyway -- Rich McHugh is my new personal hero.
