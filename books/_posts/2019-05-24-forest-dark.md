A heavy, plodding, deeply written book. Krauss is a master writer with an intellectual well deeper than most. I would've liked to go in with deeper knowledge about Jewish culture and tradition, I think it would have allowed me to enjoy the novel even more. From what I gather, this is not like Krauss's other work, but I'm looking forward to reading more by her all the same.
