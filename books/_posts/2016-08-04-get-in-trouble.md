I think this is primarily a factor of my lack of familiarity with the genre or my inability to find good fantasy books to capture my attention, but there have been very few fantasy or even pseudo fantasy stories that have moved me emotionally. Unfortunately, this is true for most of the stories in Kelly Link's <em>Get in Trouble</em>. I had a hard time getting emotionally invested in many of the characters, and the parts that worked for me were largely those that stuck to realism. That may be too harsh, there were definitely some non-realist elements that worked for me. But it was always when they were in service of the emotional journey of the protagonist or to highlight a plot or character detail.<br/><br/>My favorite stories, for what its worth, were "Secret Identity," "The New Boyfriend," and "The Summer People".
