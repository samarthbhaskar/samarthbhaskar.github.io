I tried, very hard, to find something to love about this book. The awards it received, critical and popular praise throughout last year, all made me want to find something to enjoy. But I just couldn't make it through. It took me much longer than I care to admit to make my way through. And I think I more or less came down to the quality of the writing as the biggest reason why I couldn't like this book. There wasn't enough artistry in Nguyen's writing to balance out the over-wrought, heavy, plotting. The lack of literary quality left me feeling feckless and uninterested as a reader.
