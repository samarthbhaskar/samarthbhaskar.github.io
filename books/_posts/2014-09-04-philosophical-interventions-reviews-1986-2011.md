Probably one of the best pop-philosophy books I've ever read. Nussbaum is incredibly smart, about so many topics. Feminism, sexual ethics, manliness, Indian political history, sartorial philosophy are all discussed in interesting, contextualized, deep ways. Her ability to bring in writers from Aristotle, Plato to Charles Taylor into the conversation is also remarkable.<br/><br/>Only thing keeping it from a 5-star review is that Nussbaum sometimes ends up making ad-hominem attacks, especially at other philosophers like Judith Butler, which I think she could do without.
