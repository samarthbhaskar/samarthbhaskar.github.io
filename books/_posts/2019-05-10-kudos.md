Rachel Cusk's Faye trilogy is a modern marvel. She paints a full, deep, character with minimal time in that characters head. <em>Kudos</em> is probably the least rewarding or engrossing of the three books, but only by a hair. Cusk belongs on any list of modern writers who have accomplished something new, important and meaningful in the medium of books in the 21st century.
