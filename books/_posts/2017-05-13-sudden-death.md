Sometimes the structure of a book and the content of a book perfectly align. Each chapter of this quixotic, satirical, novel is like a tennis ball in a match flying back and forth in a volley. The rhythm mirrors games-sets-matches. The breaks are perfectly placed. But I can't say the content of the book was highly convincing for me. 

This is a book as much about tennis as it is about modern identity, East/West clashes, historicization, sex and writing. If, in that stew, you care about one or two things, you'll probably enjoy this book. I found myself reading this book, wondering why I was continuing, yet unable to pull away. I can't say that's a hearty commendation, but it is an interesting fact. For that fact alone, that it kept my attention and I couldn't walk away from it, I give it props.
