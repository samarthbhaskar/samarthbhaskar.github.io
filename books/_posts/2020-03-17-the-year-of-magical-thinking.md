A friend who works in palliative care recently mentioned that "stages of grief," is a mostly debunked idea. It suggests that grief is a linear process. That once we've gone through one stage, we won't come back. In his field, grief is better understood not as something we get over, but something we learn to live with. It's a simple reformation of the idea but powerful. 

Didion's <em>The Year of Magical Thinking</em> has a classic writing trick baked into the title: you know exactly where on the journey you are because you know it's going to last 1 year. And, like the advice from palliative care professionals, it is less about getting past grief than learning to live with it. It is among some of the best memoirs I've read. And somehow quite apt for the moment we're in.
