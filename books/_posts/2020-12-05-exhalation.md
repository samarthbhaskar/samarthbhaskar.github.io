Ted Chiang seems to build his stories from the inside out. Which, I suppose, is the only way to build them. Almost every one of the stories here has a sentence, a phrase, a paragraph that (in journalism paralance) is the nut graf. Once you get there, it sucks out of some of the air from the experience of reading the story. I feel, in that moment, like I'm being watched by the author as I'm reading his story. But in almost every case, that nut graf contains something very meaningful, heartfelt, true, or some combination of these things. So ultimately it feels worthwhile.
