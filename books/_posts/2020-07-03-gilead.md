To most East Coasters, Iowa is a place that exists once every four years. Or where their talented, literary, friend keeps wanting to apply for a writing workshop. Marilynne Robinson, in this book, makes it a stand-in for much of the Midwest. A vast, open space, not densely populated, brimming with faith and an unrelenting desire to figure out how to be nice despite it all. The epistolary form of this book really worked for me. And I think it may be some of the best defenses of American Christianity, at least in its most aspirational form, that I've ever come across. 

I grew up in a town like Gilead. I didn't know specific people like John Ames, but I can easily create a composite image of a John Ames in my mind made up of many people I knew in my hometown. And the moral core of this book felt very familiar, too. 

In a time when I'm cooped up at home in NYC, I've found myself feeling nostalgic for the wide open spaces of my home state more than maybe ever. I read this book shortly before a short trip home to see family. Robinson, somehow, captured the best of the Midwest here. And the best of America, too, maybe.
