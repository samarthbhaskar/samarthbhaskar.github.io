Kitchens of the Great Midwest captures the midwest really well. The influence of Lutheranism, the cultural battles between young urban-minded and older smaller community oriented citizens, the effect of lots of driving, building communities around things like food and church because there isn't much else to bond over -- all of this rang true for me as someone raised in Illinois. <br/><br/>But beyond being a capsule of a time and place, J. Ryan Stradal wrote a great family novel in his debut work. It's easy to forget the book is essentially about the relationship between a mother and daughter, because for the majority of the book this relationship isn't a focus. But an argument could be made that everything that happens to and around Eva is related to her relationship with her mother. <br/><br/>It's easy to read this novel as pure entertainment - there's plenty of humor, action and character sugar to keep any reader entertained - but the author managed to also do some great anthropological, moralistic and ethicist work alongside.
