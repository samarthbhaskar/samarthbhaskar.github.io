I said this about falconry and nature writing after reading Helen MacDonald's <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1772965451?book_show_action=false&from_review_page=1">H is for Hawk</a>. And then again about surfing after reading William Finnegan's <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1918695636?book_show_action=false&from_review_page=1">Barbarian Days</a>. Then, naiively, I went into this book thinking I didn't care much about midwestern Catholicism. Patricia Lockwood, with her preternatural writing ability, humor, command of poetry and sharp, acerbic voice, won me over. I still don't think I care very much about midwestern Catholicism, but I loved this journey through Lockwood's upbringing, family, and trying times as a young married adult.

Memoirs (I've said this basically every time I've reviewed a memoir) succeed or fail on voice. This book has a beautiful, emotional, wise, voice. After reading a few books recently written by poets, I'm considering only reading books by poets from now on. They write. While the rest of us type.
