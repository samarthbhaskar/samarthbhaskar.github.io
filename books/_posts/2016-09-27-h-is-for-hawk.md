If memoir, as a genre, succeeds or fails on voice, this memoir has a uniquely successful voice. Reading MacDonald's writing on falconry, her relationship with her father, her descriptions of nature, her thoughts on writers who came before her, is an immersive experience. I was never in the market for a book on falconry, or a biography of T.H. White, or a book filled with lush, flowing, and at times precise nature writing, or a memoir about bereavement - but this book represents that illusive but prized literary experience, coming across something new you never you wanted, but are glad to have found.
