Indian families talk a lot. And there is much left unsaid.

The final conversation in this slim, sinewy novel left me feeling like the proverbial frog in a pot of boiling water. I was boiling but I didn't remember how I got there. Shanbhag had been turning the heat up, slowly, throughout the book but it took until the end of the novel for me to realize where I was. There's something about recent short novels like <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1856898413?book_show_action=false&from_review_page=1">The Vegetarian</a> and <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1783006645?book_show_action=false&from_review_page=1">Eileen</a> that has worked for me. I count them, and this book, among my favorite reads of the past couple of years.

For most of this book, I was thinking about globalization, class ascension, the corrupting influence of wealth, the male protagonist (who reminded me of a younger version of the father character in Akhil Sharma's <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1322069503?book_show_action=false&from_review_page=1">An Obedient Father</a>). But at the end, I was jarred awake, and remembered the tyranny of the extended Indian family. A tyranny with which I am both personally and culturally familiar. 

Shanbhag's novel is making its way around the literary circles in the US, thanks to a brilliant translation and championing by an American imprint. I hope this means we get more of his work translated for an American audience. I will happily count myself among his loyal readers.
