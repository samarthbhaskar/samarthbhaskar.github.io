This is an incredibly researched, propulsive, non-fiction account of The Troubles in Ireland. And one of the best pieces of archival work I've ever seen. When a New Yorker staff writer writes a book, you know you're in the hands of an expert. But this surpassed even my already-very-high expectations. 

I know this sort of thing exists out there, but I would love more comparative writing about the use of political violence in Ireland or South Africa with less white parts of the world like the Middle East or South Asia. It's incredible (it shouldn't be, but it is) how quickly political violence gets pathologized when it happens in Syria or Iraq but the same analysis isn't applied in mainstream consciousness when it happens in Ireland. Books like this, that unflinchingly, with great detail, but also great compassion, tell the history of terrorism and violence on the streets, torture in prisons, frustration after frustration in politics are essential. I just want that same treatment for the same kind of behavior by, for example, Muslims. If for no other reason, to complicate and bludgeon concepts like "Radical Islamic Terrorism," which has maybe even less to do with Islam as the violence in Ireland had to do with Catholicism. 

Anyway, this is a very good book. It wasn't easy to read. I was reading through my fingers, so to say, at times. But I also couldn't stop.
