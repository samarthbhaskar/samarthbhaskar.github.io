One of my favorite books of the year. I read it in a couple of sittings and wanted more when I finished. Lulu Miller was always a favorite from her Radiolab days, and learning more about her personal life and going on this journey with her as she tried to understand her own life through science, philosophy and social science was great. 

My big parting thought at the end of the book was something similar to what Jill Lepore said to Ezra Klein earlier this year on his podcast: why try to understand something as complicated as, in his case political polarization but in Miller's case her mental well being, through disciplines like science, philosophy and social science? They are subject to all sorts of weird histories and biases. Why not turn to literature, poetry, and the humanities? The answers may be of a different shape but may fit the hole Miller was describing better.
