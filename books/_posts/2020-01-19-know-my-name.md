This is one of few stories from the #metoo era written not by journalists, lawyers or screenwriters but by the survivor (I was about to write "victim" but reading this book has changed my understanding of that word) herself. It deserves as much attention and consideration as <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3156449745">"Catch and Kill"</a> or "She Said" or all the news reporting or all the TV shows and movies that will be made about this topic. Miller's writing is plain, pointed and in a more obvious way than with most books, the point of the book itself. In going on the journey through this book, you get to learn a lot about the reasons why Miller first wrote her court statement and thent his book. Miller, graciously, makes the job of reading this book a rewarding experience. There are some repetitive parts but Miller deftly guides you through the experience of living and reliving trauma and losing sense of time. 

While reading this book, I did wonder, and Miller acknolwedges this herself near the end, how her gifts as a writer play a role in her survivorship. She wrote both to heal from her trauma but also to understand herself in this new stage of her life. Maybe other survivors use writing in the same way, or art, or music, or whatever. But I also wonder about surivors who never find their outlet. 

There are traumas like sexual assault. But there are also traumas like immigration, or untreated mental health disorders, or name-a-thing about modern life. This book is a map to understanding how one incredibly strong person surived hers. We could all use a map like that at one time or another.
