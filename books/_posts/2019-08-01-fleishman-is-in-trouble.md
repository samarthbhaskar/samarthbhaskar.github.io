The hype is real. This is a highly quotable, highly highlightable, highly readable, summer read. I haven't gone more than a few days without talking to someone about this book, or seeing someone talk about it online. It's the Harry Potter of the NYC media set this summer, and these people are already all a bunch of Harry Potter nerds.

Jokes aside; themes in this book about marriage, desire, ambition, what you should want from a marriage, what you should be willing to give to a marriage all resonated with me and my friends. The author has done a brilliant job of exploring these themes in the structure of a smart, empathetic, satirical, well-paced story.
