Unlike Akhil Sharma's <em><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1322069503?book_show_action=false&from_review_page=1">An Obedient Father</a></em>, or <em>Ghachar, Ghochar</em> books that I thought could have used even more time with their characters, <em>A Burning</em> felt more suited for a short story treatment than a novel length treatment. They explore many similar themes, and arguably, this book is more powerful given the political reality in which it lands, but I found myself wanting more from this book than the author had to give. Perhaps for an unfamiliar audience this book is new enough that it does the trick but for those familiar with South Asian literature, themes about gender, politics, class, dignity and nationalism in this literature, there's not much new.

The most laudable aspect of the book were the voices Majumdar is able to inhabit with each character. That's worth the price of entry.
