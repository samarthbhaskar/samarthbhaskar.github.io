This book - a dark, twisty, uncomfortable, at times gripping, at times confusing read - is probably not for everyone. I read it in a time when I was not dealing with direct grief or processing loss, but I can imagine that in the future when I find myself in such a place, I will return to this book, to match my inner mood. 

As a reader, I take a risk when I pick up experimental works like this. These risks don't always pay off. This one didn't pay off fully, but I did gain something from reading it.
