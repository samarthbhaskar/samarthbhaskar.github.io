One of the best books I've read this year. The characters were well developed, I cared and worried about each of them. The world was at once intimate and grand. All of the troubles the protagonist went through are the troubles that plague America. And much like the auther, Henderson, I'm optimistic that America will be ok, no matter how messed up it is. I never once felt bored in this book, which is an accomplishment for a book of more than 450 pages. Even when it wasn't action packed, it never felt navel-gazey. And although the book never prominently featured a person of color, I never felt like it lacked empathy for humanity. Maybe because it beat up all of its characters equally. Henderson has done a marvelous job with his first novel, I hope this only means more stellar work in his future.
