Meg Wolitzer is an artisan of her craft. She can build characters, pace action, and carry a reader through a book with the best of her class. But, I fear, she doesn't really have much of depth of knowledge about the subject matter upon which this book is built. The satirical parts of this book were funny but the core message left a lot to be desired. The politics of this book are flimsy. The characters, however, are solid.

There are also a lot of dad jokes in this book. Which I found myself, lovingly, rolling my eyes at.

I look forward to reading more of Wolitzer's work. I'll always show up for her. But I wonder if it's time for her to move on from writing about young people. And to set her sights on interrogating the social dynamics of boomers, who deserve some of her investigative energy.
