Hari Kunzru's <em>White Tears</em> came across my radar because it was picked as a finalist in the NYC Summer Reading selection. After finishing the book, I can say I like a lot about this book -- it's use of magical realism, it's commentary on cultural appropritation, on history as something that walks around with us in the present not just something from the past, on youth and maturity -- but I don't really think of it as an NYC book, per se. In fact, if I was from the Bronx, I'd probably find this book to be a pretty condescending and frustrating portrayal of my borough.
