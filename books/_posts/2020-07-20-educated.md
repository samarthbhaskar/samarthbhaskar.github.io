After hearing about this book everywhere last year, and a number of trusted friends counting it as among their favorites of the year, we got around to listening to it on a long summer road trip. There are some tough-to-get-through parts in the first half of the book (only so many descriptions of gruesome accidents before you start to wonder where you're headed) but Westover bowled us over with this book. The story in and of itself is remarkable but the way Westover (to use her phrase) mines it for meaning, and wrests from it some universal themes about family, struggle, history and identity is the real reward.

<em>Hillybilyl Elegy</em> got a lot of attention in 2017 for being a story about "forgotten white America," that would somehow tell us something about our countrymen and women we didn't know. But, to my mind, this is that story. A story created at the extremes of society but something that has a particularly Americanness to it.
