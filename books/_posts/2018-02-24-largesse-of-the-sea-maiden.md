I loved Denis Johnson's <em><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2224137615?book_show_action=false&from_review_page=1">Train Dreams</a></em>. It's a short, powerful novella that I've thought about often since finishing it. So I was looking forward reading more short stories from Johnson. And I was not disappointed. 

There are a couple of stories in this collection that are haunting to read knowing that Johnson passed away shortly after completing them. I thought this while reading Train Dreams, but there's something particularly American about Johnson's writing and voice. The conversational tone, the steely emotions, there's a sense that wherever Johnson wrote these words, it was dusty there. 

I look forward to reading more stories by him, including Jesus' Son soon.
