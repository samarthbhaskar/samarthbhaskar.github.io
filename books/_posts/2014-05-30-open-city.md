I think I felt a real sense of kinship with the protagonist in this book because I'm spending a lot of time alone in NYC right now. The way he explores the city, makes connections with strangers, talks about his status in NYC as an outsider - all of these things spoke to me. <br/><br/>Similar to Linklater films, this book relied on voice, dialogue (internal and shared) instead of plot. I'm a fan of authors/auteurs who can pull this off. Linklater and Cole are among the best doing it right now.
