Between this episode of <a href="https://www.thecut.com/2019/11/the-cut-on-tuesdays-when-a-relationship-becomes-a-nightmare.html">"The Cut on Tuesdays"</a>, this YouTube <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xhigiIRvms">talk</a> and the fact that this memoir topped many "Best of 2019" lists, I was eager to catch up with it. My friend at work found a galley and I dove right in. I ended up reading it over just a couple of sittings. The experience of reading this book felt a lot like browsing the internet (an analogy I recently made about <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2957014029?book_show_action=false&from_review_page=1">another book</a>): some chapters are are short as a sentence, most don't last more than a couple of pages. Like twitter or Tumblr, this book washes over you and you don't want to put it down. It rewards our increasingly scattered sense of attention. 

(Relatedly: Patricia Lockwood's <a href="https://www.lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v41/n04/patricia-lockwood/the-communal-mind">recent talk</a> about the experience of being a writer in the age of the internet is fantastic.)

The subject of the book itself is not easy. The abuse described within, the history (or lack of history) of stories of abuse in lesbian relationships, the author's upbringing, the social commentary and connections to film, literature and mythology, all come together through deft, quick writing. The story here is not just one of survival and thriving but also of self-exploration and understanding.
