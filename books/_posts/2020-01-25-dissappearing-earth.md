The first chapter is one of the best chapters I've read in recent memory. The remaining chapters are very very good too, but the bar was set so high with the first, it was hard not to feel like I was missing something throughout. That said, I enjoyed reading this book and would recommend it to anyone as a great example of diving fully into a new part of the planet that feels like a different world from ours entirely. And learning about it one chapter at a time. 

I'm sure Russians disagree, but I find it impressive that Phillips wrote such an impressive book after a Fulbright term there.
