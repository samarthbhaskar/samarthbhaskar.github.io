The last section of this book really got to me in ways I was not expecting. Perhaps it was the frayed emotional state that comes along with quarantine life, or maybe it was the build up from the first few sections of the book. Whatever the reason, I found that section very moving. 

Families ask a lot of each other. The give and take is not uniform or fair. And this book does a fantastic job at revealing the big and small injustices that siblings, parents, and children enact on one another over decades. Over the course of the book, you also get a sense for why, despite it all, families (if you so choose) are some of the central definining features of our identities in our lives. We don't choose the ones we're born in. And we only get to shape a small part of what shape they take. 

Like Hulu's Ramy, this book is among of the best evocatios of modern Islam in America.
