A book in the making of something by Maggie Nelson or Rebecca Solnit. Beware that it is much more poetic and affective than it is a novel with a plot. If you're ok with that, like I am, especially when the writing, the conceit, the writer and the feelings are so worthwhile, this book is wonderful.

In millennial speak: Ben Lerner, mentor me daddy. Run me over with a truck.
