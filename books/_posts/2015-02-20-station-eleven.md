After seeing this book recommended across many best-of-2014 lists, I decided to dive in. I find the central question - is it possible to have culture without civilization? - very interesting. Although, if I'm being honest, I don't think it's enough interesting enough to rise up in the ranks of some of the best thought experiments to write a book about. However, the author starts with this question and goes to very interesting places. <br/><br/>I'm not usually compelled by end-of-world dramas, but this one felt very realistic. I also liked that Toronto played a big role in this book. After reading NYC centric books for the better part of last year, it was nice to mix things up a bit. <br/><br/>Ultimately, I think I liked this book because it tried to answer its big main question. I don't think it ever came up with a clear, precise answer, but it was a good meditation on it.
