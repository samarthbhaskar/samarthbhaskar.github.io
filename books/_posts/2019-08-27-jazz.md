Jazz is a sad, sad book, written in beautiful, lilting language. Like <em><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2050027700?book_show_action=false&from_review_page=1">But Beautiful</a></em> by Geoff Dyer, Morrison's <em>Jazz</em> is a literary version of jazz. It is minor in note, almost throughout, and it adapts some of jazz (the genre's) best elements: connected to history but hyper modern, full of contradictions and violations of expectation, purely American in its provenance and its development, and, at its core, reliant on improvisation as its engine of creativity. 

Morrison's writing in this book is all of those things, but with the written word. The story stems from a news story Morrison read and took as inspiration. But the book is much more about improvising on that theme

The experience of reading this book mirrors the experience of listening to jazz, for me. Not everything connects. Sometimes you find yourself wandering away in your head. But when you come back, the core idea is still there. And, as a listener, you're rewarded for going along on the journey the artist is going on, too. Most often, neither you nor the artist know exactly how you'll get to the end, just that you're traveling together.
