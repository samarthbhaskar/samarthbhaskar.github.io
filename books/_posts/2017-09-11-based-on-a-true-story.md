Norm MacDonald may not be a genius but he's a genius comedian. In this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbthMC6spAE">video essay</a>, Evan Puschak makes the case better than I can in a book review. MacDonald is well read, always pushing the boundaries of mainstream comedy, never settles for or talks down to his audience, and is has a deceptively simple sense of humor. His writing, unfortunately, doesn't quite impress in the same way. And in terms of great comedian memoirs or autobiographies or whatever else this is I'm not sure it lives up to say, Steve Martin's <em><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1854236631?book_show_action=false&from_review_page=1">Born Standing Up</a></em>, but it is a formidable entry in the genre.
