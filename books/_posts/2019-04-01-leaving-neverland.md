After reading Margot Jefferson's "On Michael Jackson," I felt somewhat more prepared to watch this film. I knew, going in, that it would be a difficult emotional experience, not least because Jackson's music has played a big role in my life. 

The experience of watching this film, though, was no less devastating. The testimony in this film is brutal, haunting, specific and traumatic. It leaves no doubts that Jackson abused these men as children, if not others. Going forward in life, knowing that I have to hold all of these facts about Jackson's life in my head is a reality. But my role as a fan pales in comparison to the effect that Jackson had on these men and their families. 

As an act of film-making, this doc made some choices I probably wouldn't have. But all that seems beside the point, entirely.
