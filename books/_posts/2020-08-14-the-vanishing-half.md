A lot of great exploration of identity building of all sorts: twins, actors, draq queens, trans people, fingerprint readers, liars. And of the very important question that is under-explored about "passing," namely, what do you lose when you choose to become someone else? According to this book, at least, you lose a lot. 

There's also something powerful about a book that builds a world set in the heights of 20th century America, arguably among the best places and times to ever be alive as a human being, but shatters that surface level understanding of what made America great.
