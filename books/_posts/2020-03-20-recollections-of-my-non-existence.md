Before quarantine and lockdown hit, seeing Rebecca Solnit discuss this book in person was one of the last activities we did out in the world. We learned weeks and months later that coronavirus was already here by then. Even on stage. Solnit talked about feeling the presense of this pandemic arriving in the US after its journey around the world. And the auditorium had a tense sense in it. A few weeks later, Leslie Jamison, who conducted the conversation on stage with Solnit <a href="https://www.nybooks.com/daily/2020/03/26/since-i-became-symptomatic/">wrote in the NYRB</a> about her experience with the virus. No one knew the virus was there that night, but it was a silent presence all around us.

Solnit's memoir, as with her essays and other works over the last couple of decades, have a way of revealing the color of air. You walk around all day thinking the air around you is just air, it has no color. Solnit, like a magician, uses words to show you that no, not only is there color, but it is working in all sorts of distorting ways to mess with your position in the world. In this book, she does it through stories about herself as a younger person. But the outcome is the same. You walk away with a sense of revelation that the world works in a different way than you previously knew.
