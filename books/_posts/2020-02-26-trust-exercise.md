<em>Trust Exercise</em> ended up being a book I more admired than liked. I appreciated the things Susan Choi is doing here with commentary on power, depictions of authorial intent and outcome, the complicated flow of perpetrator and victim in every relationship, and the challenging but rewarding experience of not having your hand held too much while reading a piece of fiction. 

But some of the overwrought writing, arguably resulting from the setting in a drama and arts high school, was difficult for me to get over. And I got the sense that unlike <em>Fates and Furies</em> and <em>Assymettry</em>, books that attempt similar high wire acts, <em>Trust Exercise</em> was more satisified with the degree of difficult it was aiming for than masterfully pulling it off.

All that said, it was still a good reading experience. And a book that will make for a good book club discussion later this month.
