An impressively written book featuring two down-and-out, immoral, leathery men who probably don't deserve any of the sympathy the author gets you to feel for them. And a young woman who is suffering, too. This is not a new thought but there's something about the Irish writer, landscape, mood and culture that weighs heavy like a sopping wet raincoat. I happened to be in the mood for a good heavy rain, so this worked for me. But I could imagine that it might not for some others.
