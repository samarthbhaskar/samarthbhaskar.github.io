I didn't realize "Green" was a YA novel until I finished reading it. That would have colored my experience of reading quite differently. But I thought it was a good debut novel, and a useful attempt at a white person describing his experience learning about and adjusting to a racist society. I tend to read more work by nonwhite writers addressing these topics so this made for an interesting addition to that conversation.
