Steve Martin's biography-not-autobiography is a breezy, quick read. I grew up knowing Martin as more Hollywood dad than avant-garde standup comic, so much of the material in this book was new to me. This book sails when Martin is being candid and honest about his family life, his time on the road, and his formative years a performer. Much like his comedy (which I've seen mostly on Youtube), there's something stripped down about Martin's writing. His sentences are not complex, his writing is not lyrical, his insights are not deep. What you get, mostly, are reflections and stories about an extraordinary life lived by an ordinary man.
