For a couple of months this fall, "Three Women" became the most talked about book across my corner of the internet. My experience of reading it was (1) fast, because it is written in a very readable and gripping way, (2) shocking, because Taddeo did some incredible reporting for this work of non-fiction and (3) sad, because much of what is described in this book wasn't exactly new to me (if anyone has listened to any woman in their life talk about this topic, you've heard versions of these stories, or worse, experienced them) but it was described in deep, vivid, affecting detail. 

I went into this book expecting something like Maggie Nelson's exploration of "cruelty" and that's not quite what this book is. But it is a compelling exploration of "desire," that may not work for everyone but it worked pretty well for me.

My only gripe is with Taddeo's writing style which I felt did not match the caliber of reporting at times.
