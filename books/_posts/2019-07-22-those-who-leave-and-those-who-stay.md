I've been taking my time with the Ferrante books because they are amazing and I want them to last forever. This one was a bit less engaging than the previous. The 2nd in the series is set during a more dramatic, salacious, memorable part of the characters' lives (teenage years). The 3rd book in the series features young adult years, more political awareness (probably my favorite parts) and some struggle and realization that inequality and separation are among the inevitabilities of life. 

I'll probably wait a while to finish the last book but I'm looking forward to how the story of these remarkable characters wraps up.
