In some of the press she did after <em><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2464106419?book_show_action=false&from_review_page=1">My Year of Rest and Relaxation</a></em>, Moshfegh mentioned that the work she is most proud of, or perhaps her favorite of her work, is <em>McGlue</em>. I came across a copy in a book store the other day and decided to pick it up. After a quick afternoon read, I can see why she would be proud of this work. It is, in a writerly sense, an admirable challenge to present to yourself in 2014: write a novella about a drunk, absent minded, sailer from the 1850s. Make it immersive and of its time but also modern in its psychology. 

Moshfegh accomplished the goal she set out for herself relatively well. But, ultimately, I'm just not sure there's much to recommend in the book. Perhaps it is more a book to admire than to recommend.
