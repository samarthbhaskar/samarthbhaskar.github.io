Immediately upon finishing this book, I went out and purchased <em>Conversations with Friends</em>. With deep, terse, emotional writing (and writing about emotions) like this, I couldn't wait to read more of Rooney's work. I look forward to spending more time with that book, too.

Although <em>Normal People</em>, mostly in its last third, toes the line of melodrama and unbelievable (or maybe unwarranted) turns of plot, it doesn't go far enough to lose the thread completely. I felt totally rapt by and bought into the two main characters lives, both as individuals and as frustrated lovers. Many of the turns and twists in their formative years felt familiar to me, even if in my case it wasn't just one person with whom I was on similar journeys.
