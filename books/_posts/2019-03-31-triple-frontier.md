A good heist movie inside a war movie. And certainly meatier than an equivalent second-tier action movie would have been in the 90s or 00s, but I still think it falls short of great. A better heist movie inside a war movie is <em>Three Kings</em>. I also would love to see Mark Boal + Katherine Bigelow's version of this film.
