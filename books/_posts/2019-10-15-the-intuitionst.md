This was my third or fourth Colson Whitehead book this summer -- I happened to go on a tear after reading and loving "The Nickel Boys" -- and my least favorite. I had a hard time getting through the story telling even though the characters were very interesting. From a cursory glance at reviews, it seems like others found it a difficult book to engage with, on a page-by-page level.

As an allegory for dialectical social theories about progress, I find the metaphor at the center of this book compelling. But as the experience of reading a 250 page novel, less so.
