I picked up "Conversations with Friends" immediately after reading <em><a href="">https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2802279986</a>Normal People</em>. I enjoyed this book slightly more but both were massively enjoyable reading experiences, especially because Rooney's writing about emotionality, sex, partnerships and friendship is so rewarding. 

In both books, her use of BDSM as a transgressive sex practice, or a marker for trauma feels somewhat trite. But its not enough to sour me on the experience of reading Rooney's books.
