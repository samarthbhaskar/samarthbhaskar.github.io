Of the series, <em>Some Hope</em> is the least compelling novella so far. The life of British aristocrats and socialites, their petty differences, their status consciousness and snide bickering is not of interest to me, or ostensibly, to the story of Patrick Melrose. The parts of this book where Patrick is front and center, especially the dinner scene when he shares the story of his childhood, and the ending, save this book. If not entirely, to a great extent. 

St. Aubyn's commitment to telling every episode of this story through single events is understandable (even laudable), but each of these events seems succeed most when Patrick Melrose is at the center, and St. Aubyn is relying on his story to move the writing forward.
