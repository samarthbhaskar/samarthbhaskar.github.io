I'm a big fan of Yanagihara's <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1237222067?book_show_action=false&from_review_page=1">A Little Life</a>. It is a polarizing book but I love it deeply and think about it often. It took me a while to catch up with her previous work but I'm glad I made time for "The People In The Trees." While this book is not as successful, overall as "Little Life," I found it an engrossing read. It is the work of a younger writer but some of the promise of her future writing is in here. 

There are some unsettling scenes and characters in this book. But the success of the book is in the fact that it gives you every reason to believe the worst and every reason to keep reading and hope that it isn't true.
