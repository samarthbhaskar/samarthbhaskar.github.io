George Saunders' background as a technical writer is always apparent, at least to me. This book, in some ways, is a work place comedy. The work place happens to be a cemetary. And the co-workers happen to be ghosts. What Saunders developed in his experience as an office worker, you could say, is a similar perspective to what Ricky Gervais developed working in an office too. 

However, what Saunders has, almost certainly as a natural part of his personality, is a deep and abiding sense of pathos and emotionality. This trait shows up in his writing, but it is always buttressed by lots of jokes and self-deprication. A combo that works for me -- usually.

This book didn't work as well, for me, as Saunders' short stories. I didn't feel engaged until about the halfway point. And even the 2nd half didn't have as much of a payoff for me, as stories in <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/621841305?book_show_action=false&from_review_page=1">Pastoralia</a> and <i>CivilWarLand in Bad Decline</i>. Perhaps it was the mix of voice, anecdotes from historical research and ghost dialog, that didn't work for me. There were moments when I felt the weight of what Saunders' had set out to write about, and those moments were fantastic. But, overall, I found myself wanting more of the American folk sensibility that he brought to something like his New Yorker Trump reporting piece.
