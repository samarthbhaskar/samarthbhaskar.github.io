I was only passingly familiar with some of the neuroscience concepts Lisa Feldman Barrett uses to construct her book, so I probably have a more layman's evaluation than other readers. I found this book highly compelling, believable, and useful even in the moment I was reading it. Some of its concepts -- especially in the chapters about emotions and the law, emotion and illness and mastering your emotions -- are highly useful. I've found myself referencing concepts about body budgeting and pattern matching in my day to day life since reading this book. 

Some of the criticisms I've seen about how universal the constructs of this book aim to be, about the strawman "classical" view of emotions construction, or about the writing may be true but didn't detract from how helpful I found what this book aims to do.
