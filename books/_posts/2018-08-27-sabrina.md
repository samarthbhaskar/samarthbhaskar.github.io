I don't read many graphic novels so when this one was shortlisted for the Booker prize, I nominated it for one of my book clubs to read and discuss. I very much enjoyed the experience of reading this book, and although it was largely driven by exposition, I do think the graphic elements added to the experience. 

The biggest thought I walked away with was: how peculiar and awful that we live in a time when victims of tragedy, like parents of school shootings, are traumatized and targeted over and over again by dispicable people like Alex Jones. That plot line in this book, more than anything else, stuck with me. Seeing a character wallow in tragedy and have his wounds poked at, and being brought there viscerally as a reader, was a powerful aspect of this book. I hope no one ever again has to go through any experience like that. But I know that won't be the case.
