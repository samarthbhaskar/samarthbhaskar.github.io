I was watching Martin Scorses's <em>After Hours</em> and the protagonist in the film is reading this book in one scene. He and another title character have a short conversation about it in a diner. It made me (1) deeply miss sitting in an NYC diner, reading a book, nursing a burger and a beer. I can't wait to do that again some day when the pandemic passes. 

And (2) want to read this book.

I enjoyed it and saw much of how it influenced a whole generation of writers after Miller.
