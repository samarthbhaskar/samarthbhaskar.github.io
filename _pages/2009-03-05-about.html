<p>I am a former senior data analyst for the 2012 Obama for America re-election campaign. While there, I got my first taste of the world of data-science and I am curious to learn more. I aim to continue exploring the role of statistical inference, computer science tools and domain expertise in various socially-oriented enterprises. My next adventure will be in New York City, working with the data team at Etsy.</p>
<p>Previously I was a graduate student in the Social Sciences at the University of Chicago. My academic and professional interests are primarily in social science methodology, analytics, statistical inference and econometrics. I am an unabashed data-nerd and always interested in new tools and methods to approach big data problems.</p>
<p>I completed my undergraduate education at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. While there I received my bachelor's degree in International Studies. I studied Modern Standard Arabic for 3 and a half years and conducted research on Arab media. I also studied abroad at the American University in Dubai, interned with the Global Studies Department and with the downstate offices of Senator Dick Durbin. I was also  involved in the minority student population on campus and with the South-Asian performing arts community. I have worked for Greenberg Quinlan Rosner as an intern in Washington DC. I aided in polling and research for various domestic and international political clients, as well as corporate and non-governmental entities.</p>
<p>I have completed multiple triathlons, half-marathons and marathons and swam competitively in the Illinois High School Association swimming circuit. As an undergrad I sang in an all-male Hindi/English a cappella group called Chai-Town.</p>
<p>This site is an on-going and self-evolving entity that I have intermittently updated with personal, professional and academic posts. All thoughts and opinions are my own and do not reflect those of my professional or academic affiliations.</p>
