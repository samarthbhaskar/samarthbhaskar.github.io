Rewatched for the first time after its debut in 2017. Like <em>The Force Awakens</em> I remembered way more about the plot and charater developments in this movie than I expected. In my original review, I mentioned the meta-textual comparisons to the Marvel universe of the 2000s and 2010s, but I don't know if that comparison really holds, given how much more memorable these films are than any or every Marvel film (save for maybe Thor Ragnarok and Avengers Endgame). 

If we've learned anything about commentary and discussion on the internet in the 2010s, it is that nothing is better at centering and helping something "succeed" like controversy and conflict. <em>Joker</em> out-performed expectations because Todd Phillips was willing to spark flames. Even Martin Scorcese ginned up more interest in <em>The Irishman</em> by taking aim the Marvel Universe just before release. The JJ Abrams vs Rian Johnson school, in my mind, is another instance of this type of organized flame war that results in people talking about what you want them to be talking about. To put too fine a point on it, this strategy has made its way all around culture and also into politics. 

With all that said, I'm but human, and not above allegiances. I will now and forever be Team Rian Johnson.
