Last year's <em>Gone Girl</em> had some redeeming qualities. It had some interesting subsersive gender themes. For people like me who hadn't read the book, the twist was entertaining. Fincher's directing and cinematography were enjoyable on the big screen.

I went into <em>The Girl on the Train</em> with similar expectations. I figured the characters and plot wouldn't be impressive, but maybe some other aspects of the movie would draw me in. Unfortunately, I found nothing to draw me in. No interesting ideas, no interesting plot themes, the twist was largely predictable and not that well executed, a Middle Eastern therapist spoke Spanish (for whatever reason), Emily Blunt had chapped lips which I guess were meant to make her seem unappealing but she's still Emily Blunt so that didn't quite work either.

What I'm trying to say, I guess, is that this is not a good movie.
