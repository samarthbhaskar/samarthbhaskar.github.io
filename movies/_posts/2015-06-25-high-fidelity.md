 1. I didn't realize High Fidelity came out in 2000. I thought it was way earlier. 

2. Nick Hornby is a good writer. A very good writer.

3. The shop Rob owns is on Milwaukee and Honore in Wicker Park. And he used to DJ at the Double Door. I lived on that block for 2 years. It still has a great vibe, although different from 2000.
