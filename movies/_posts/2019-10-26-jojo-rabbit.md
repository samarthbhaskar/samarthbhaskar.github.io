Taika Waititi's worldview, especially in films like <em>Jojo Rabbit</em>, <em><a href="https://letterboxd.com/samarthbhaskar/film/boy-2010/">Boy</a></em> and <em><a href="https://letterboxd.com/samarthbhaskar/film/hunt-for-the-wilderpeople/">Hunt for the Wilderpeople</a></em>, and relatedly his approach to directorial tone management, are quite similar. He primarily relies on earnestness, pathos and humor to bring the viewer in. And when you're lulled into a sense of comfort in the world he's built for you, he lands emotional body blows, but he rarely knocks you out. 

The Hitler stuff in this movie is only a minor aspect of what it's about. And, more or less, it's pulled off well. It's too bad that that point became the focal point of all the marketing and conversation around the film. But I suppose that is to be expected to some degree. 

Seeing a preview for the upcoming Terrance Mallick <em>A Hidden Life</em> before this film also helped frame this film. The majority of WWII and Nazism films I've seen have tended to treat the topic with one of a few approaches: hyper morality, good over evil triumphalism or something in these veins. For a topic that so clearly crystalizes, at least in the grandest sense, what humans can do to each other, one would imagine story tellers would have a few more notes to play with. A lot of reviews I've seen of this film, ask the question, "why, in 2019, did Waititi feel he needed to create this film?" And I think, one answer, could be to play a different note, perhaps.
