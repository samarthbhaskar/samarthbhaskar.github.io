I kind of think this is a masterpiece? Or maybe I just think that because I watched it during the week of the Portland protests and Federal repression. And because 2020 is bringing every inequality in our society, elite failures, and threadbare social fabric but also powerful collective action up in a way that felt like it belonged only to history books for a long time.
