Trey Edward Shults's <a href="https://letterboxd.com/samarthbhaskar/film/krisha-2015/">Krisha</a> was one of my favorite films of 2015. With <em>It Comes At Night</em>, Shults continues exploring the scariest of all institutions â€” family. And if there's anything scarier than your own family, it may be other people's families. 

Horror films are difficult for me to get lost in, I usually spend a lot of time reminding myself that I'm watching a movie and peeking through squinted eyes. I understand that horror is many film-makers' preferred genre because it is so tied up with the history of film making and it allows for pure, unmitigated immersion for most audiences. So although the purely horror parts of this film were terrifying for me, and kept taking me out of the experience (or deeper than I wished to go), I ultimately enjoyed the film. 

Pure bleakness and desperation aren't most people's idea of a good story. But despair, when pulled off as well as Shults pulls it off, works for me.
