 Clouds of Sils Maria is a layered film. And each layer is well calibrated to the next. This interplay between the film we're watching as an audience, the play the actors are preparing for, their conversations about their lives (as characters) and as actors (in a play) serving as commentary about acting (in the real world), all work well together to create tension and keep the audience's attention. Assayas pulled off a high-wire act in directing this script, for which he deserves praise.

But the real praise goes to Binoche, Stewart and Grace-Moretz who all turned in fantastic performances. A film about acting requires a lot from its actors, and the main protagonists here did not dissapoint.
