 Blade Runner deserves all the accolades it has received since its release for many reasons. Chief among these is its influence on the sci-fi and noir genre. Many successful films since Blade Runner have employed many of its tools, built worlds that resemble futuristic LA, and lifted character types from this film. 

However, I don't think that's enough to bring Blade Runner up to the status that it deserves. Blade Runner deserves high acclaim because it makes high action comprehensible. It brings complex emotion, intricate world building, challenging photography and cinematography and other artistic successes to a mainstream audience. And more than anything else, it complicates the simple protagonist and villain relationship. By the end of the film, I wasn't sure I loved Dekker and I certainly didn't hate Roy. In fact, Dekker spitting in Roy's face, more or less forcing himself on Rachel, and generally being a shitty guy made it clear that he wasn't supposed to be a totally lovable protagonist anyway.

I ended up watching a version of this that included the narration from Harrison Ford. I definitely could've done without that.
