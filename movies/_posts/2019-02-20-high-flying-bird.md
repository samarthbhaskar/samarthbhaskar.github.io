1st blush: wow, you really need Barry Jenkins to transfer a playwrite like Tarrell McCraney to screen huh?

Upon more reflection: On the border between experimental and mass market for Soderbergh, clearly a side project. But I thought for a mid-tier movie it had some really great elements (André Holland! Zazie! Fish-eye camera pans! basketball jokes! Tarell McCraney’s dialog!).
