Airplane re-watch.

This film has become, and will become, more and more poignant as our society doubles down on entrepreneurs, late stage capitalism, and narratives about hyper-successful individuals like Steve Jobs, Travis Kalanick and others as a central feature of our society. The things this story tells us about unregulated or unconstrained grabs for power, money, success or ambition are important lessons for us to learn and contend with as continue our unabated march toward progress.
