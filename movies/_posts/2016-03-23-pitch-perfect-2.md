 After seeing <em>Magic Mike XXL</em> recently, I have high expectations for sequels. Especially sequels that don't have much to prove. I enjoyed Pitch Perfect 2 (my own acappella background and embarrassment notwithstanding), but it could've gone in a much more subversive direction. They had some fun with tropes about women-led comedies, but I think they could've done more.

Regardless, Rebel Wilson steals the show, and the others aren't far behind. And more of Keegan Michael Key in everything please.
