[LetterboxD review link](http://letterboxd.com/samarthbhaskar/film/confirmation/)

 As a story, and an episode of history, this is one of the most fascinating. The politics of gender, race, class, power and media are all at play in this story. They reach out and grab the listener's attention from the first minute. It's easy to wonder what our country and supreme court would look like if this had worked out differently. 

But as a narrative, <em>Confirmation</em> comes off heavy-handed. It tries too hard to seem even-handed. With so much "on one hand, on the other," it ends up largely falling flat for the viewer. The lead performances are strong, but the writing and story telling is not sharp.

With that being said, I have two questions: (1) did newscasters in the 90s not know how to pronounce harassment? and (2) why did no one cast Greg Kinnear as Joe Biden until now?
