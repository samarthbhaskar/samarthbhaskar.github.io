 An actor's delight, and a delight for us to see Harvey Keitel, William Hurt, Forest Whitaker, Harold Perrineau, Stockard Channing, Ashley Judd (who may have outperformed everyone with the least time on screen) take the challenge and run with it. In so far as director's are partially responsible for an actor's success, this can be considered a directorial acheivement. But beyond that, the film lacks a powerful script, and a strong artistic drive to be more than a good film with some great performances.
