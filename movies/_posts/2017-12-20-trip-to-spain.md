The comparison to the "Before" trilogy are apt, but they fall short in terms of emotional or philosophical weight. These films are funny, pleasant hangout films, a British equivalent to a mumble core hangout film perhaps. None the less, I love hanging out with these guys, not least because I think if someone were to film me hanging out with my friends, it would probably look a lot like this. Dumb, aspirational erudite jokes, a lot of time spent talking over food at restaurants, and a low-level of constant competition for no real reward in the end.
