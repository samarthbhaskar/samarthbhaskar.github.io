<em>Other People</em>, although full of fine moments (especially the final scenes), and fine acting, never really broke its "trying-overly-hard to be an indie film" quality for me. I was reminded of a line in Noah Baumbach's <em>Frances Ha</em> when Sophie, Frances' best friend, enters an apartment and remarks something like "it's just that this apartment is very...aware of itself." I felt similarly about this film. David, the protagonist, is aware of himself, which is a fine quality to ascribe to a character and Jesse Plemmons plays it well. But it's not a quality you want from the film altogether. 

I re-watched <em>Garden State</em> a couple of years ago. I hadn't seen it since its release in 2004. I couldn't even finish the film because I found it so hyper-aware of itself. Every line of dialog sounded like it was written by a pre-teen who had just discovered The Perks of Being a Wallflower. <em>Other People</em> was not as excruciating a watch, but some of the same qualities kept me from fully connecting with the film, its characters, and its story.
