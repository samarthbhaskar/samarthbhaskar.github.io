 There's plenty to complain about - a lack of imagination on the director's part, unnecessary gratuitous sex scenes, a third act that becomes a little too "Behind The Music"-esque but overall this was a solid film. Biopics, especially about groups, especially about music groups are hard to do, but the writers pulled this off well.

I was most impressed with the cast and their performances. I didn't know until after that O'Shea Jackson Jr. Ice Cube's real life son, played him in the movie. The whole time I was marveling at how good the casting was for that part. Jason Mitchell, who played Easy E, carried the film emotionally with aplomb. 

More than anything else, I'm glad this film was made to commemorate an important moment in the history of Hip Hop, art, and contemporary America. Not to mention, properly elevating two huge American artists - Ice Cube and Dr. Dre. It boggles the mind to think about how much success Dre has had in the last 30 years. He walked away, multiple times, from hugely successful enterprises to come back again more successfully. A Horatio Alger for contemporary times if there ever was one.
