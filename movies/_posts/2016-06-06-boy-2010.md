 My introduction to Taika Waititi was through <em>What We Do In The Shadows</em>, which I loved. In preparation for his upcoming <em>Hunt for the Wilderpeople</em>, I sought out <em>Boy</em> and happily it was streaming on Netflix. As the Coen brothers once said directing is all about tone management. Waititi knows the tone he strives for and achieves it time and again. The tone of <em>Boy</em> matches very well the tone of <em>What We Do In The Shadows</em>, and both have me looking forward to his future work.

Watching this film, I was reminded of <em>The Descendents</em>. A similar tropical theme and a story about a father's relationship to his children and the absence of a mother led me to some comparisons. <em>Boy</em>, better than <em>The Descendents</em>, conveyed the emotions of children dealing with having to take care of a parent while another parent is entirely missing.
