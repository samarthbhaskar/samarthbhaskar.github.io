One of the year's best films, and rewarding to watch at home in the company of a partner or family to mimic the intimacy on screen. Kathryn Hahn has been turning in incredible performance after incredible performance for more than a decade now. Her work on "Transparent" and "I Love Dick" elevated those shows. Her work here, along with Paul Giamatti, made this one of the best explorations of intimacy and modern love I've see in some time. 

Also the Knausgaard joke got me real good :-).
