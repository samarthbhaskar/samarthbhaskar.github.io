A simple, understated indie, streaming on Netflix that came across my radar thanks to the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/watching">NYT Watching site</a>. The first half, which sets up an interesting dynamic between the two protagonists, and sets the table stakes for dramatic tension, was much better than the second half, which mostly fails to keep the momentum tense, develop the characters convincingly and not devolve too quickly into saccharine indie tropes. 

In some ways in reminded of <em><a href="https://letterboxd.com/samarthbhaskar/film/buzzard/">Buzzard</a></em>, a 2014 directorial debut. The makings of a film-maker with a unique perspective, if undeveloped, are here. But it'll take some more development and staying true to his personal voice for Adam Leon to succeed as a film-maker.
