<em><a href="https://letterboxd.com/samarthbhaskar/film/krisha-2015/">Krisha</a></em>, Trey Edward Shults's 2015 narrative debut would make a great double feature with <em>Diane</em>. The emotions, colors, dialog, and story of <em>Diane</em> are almost perfect foils for what happens in <em>Krisha</em>. 

Another good pairing would be <em>Hillbilly Elegy</em>, JD Vance's 2016 memoir that focused on the role of community, personal responsibility and small town ethics in the building up and tearing down of American culture. <em>Diane</em>, if only slightly less heavily, is interested in some of the same ethics and culture. There are some parts of the film that are weighed down by the moral weight of Diane's saintliness but, overall, the film (especially the first 2 acts) succeeds at what it set out to do.
