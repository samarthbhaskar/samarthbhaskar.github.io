This movie...(lowers sunglasses)...punches above its weight.

Highlights include:

Nick Nolte sounding like he swallowed a bag of nickels before saying "the devil you know..."
Frank Grillo, Brendan's trainer, I hope gets cast as Tony Horton in a biopic about P90X someday. He was born for the role, honestly.
And Brian Callen playing himself playing Joe Rogan basically.
