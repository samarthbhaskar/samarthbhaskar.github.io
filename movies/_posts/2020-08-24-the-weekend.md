After watching <a href="https://letterboxd.com/samarthbhaskar/film/spree-2020/">Spree</a>, I had to watch this to cleanse my palette and remind myself why Sasheer Zamata is such a rising star on SNL. She carries this film, light on her feet, lovable and destestable all the same. More starring roles for Zamata, please.
