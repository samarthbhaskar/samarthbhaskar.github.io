Cynthia Erivo and Jeff Bridges put in great performances, and the story has a lot of promise in the first two-thirds. Then, something happens in the final third of the film that doesn't quite live up to the suspense it built.

But, anyway, back to Cynthia Erivo. She can run, she can sing, she can act. What can't she do?
