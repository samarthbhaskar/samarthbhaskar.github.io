ACT UP has become something of a case study in sociology, social movements, communications, and political science classes. I remember studying it throughout college and grad school as a successor to the Civil Rights and Anti-War movements of the 60s and 70s. How this movie managed to capture both the human scale of the issue, the political struggle, and manage to dramatize MEETINGS is beyond me. A fantastic film, worth adding to the syllabi of some of the classes I took in college.
