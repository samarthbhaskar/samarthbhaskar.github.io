[LetterboxD review link](https://letterboxd.com/samarthbhaskar/film/gemini-man-2019/)

About 12 years ago, I was a student at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. I was active in the Asian American Cultural Center there. One day, during a local film festival (RIP Roger Ebert, long live Ebert Fest), Ang Lee stopped by to give a short talk in the lawn. He spent about 20 total minutes at the center, and talked to students for about 5 minutes. In his speech, he recounted his short time on campus as an international student, never feeling at home, building resentment toward the students and community there for feeling like an outsider and that the only good thing that happened to him was that he met his wife there. I don't remember, specifically, but he didn't even pause to remark on the fact that we were all standing at the Asian American Cultural Center, which now provided exactly the kind of community he was decrying. 

Maybe, over time, Lee's thoughts about his own past have moderated. And maybe the same is true for Will Smith, who might have his own reasons for resentment about his past. But none of that really came across in a genuine way in this film. Maybe that's too much to ask of an action movie, who knows.

Some of the action was cool, though. Also there was a LOT of very aggressive product placement and brand mentions.
