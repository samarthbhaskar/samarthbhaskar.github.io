<em>Elle</em> has a lot of things going for it. Not the least of which is Isabelle Huppert at her acting and artistic crest. This material, about sexuality and power, but also about family, aging, guilt and taboo, in a lesser actor's hands could've withered and fallen apart. Huppert, in conjunction with Verhoeven, instead create a complex, compelling exploration of the role of power in sexual violence and sexuality.

In an earlier film, Catherine Breillat's <em>Abuse of Weakness</em>, Huppert explores some similar themes. In that film, I contend, she is working through an even more complex, fascinating character, in part because it is a depiction of real events. 

I've come to expect greatness from Huppert (much like her French compatriot Juliette Binoche) every time she is on screen. I was not disappointed this time.
