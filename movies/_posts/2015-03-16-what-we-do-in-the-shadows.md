 I do this thing, when I write about movies, where I have to find some meaning or commentary to write about. I'm going to try not to do that here, because that would be a disservice to this movie. If this movie is in conversation with anything social or current, its our cultural moment with vampires. And maybe with mockumentaries as a genre. That's about it. 

Despite that, or maybe because of it, it is also one of the funniest movies I've seen in 2015. It takes a silly premise, a bunch of vampire flatmates deal with a fish-out-of-water new vampire, and keeps the jokes coming. There was a moment when I thought, oh no, they're going to run out of jokes, but almost immediately after that the word "swearwolves" was uttered and I was proven wrong.

Only Lovers Left Alive attempted this same thing, to elevate vampire stories into something more interesting than Twilight. They accomplished that goal, and then same. What We Do in the Shadows does the same, with aplomb.
