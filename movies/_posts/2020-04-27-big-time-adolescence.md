A millennial + Gen Z buddy comedy that's fraught with tension, corruption, love, resistance and angst. But the reality is, we're in this thing together. And the mess that Boomers and GenX are leaving for us means, it's up to us to save ourselves.

Anyway, that's too political a read for what is a relatively understated movie. But I couldn't help but think about that as this relationship blossomed on screen.
