A documentary with a strong Jim Jarmusch touch to it. Iggy Pop and Jarmusch were both in attendance at the NYFF screening I attended. Iggy, his body broken, his skin leathery, his voice hoarse, is no less spirited today than he was at age 20. Much of the film is centered around stories he tells on camera or off camera. His zeal for life, and his fondness for the time he spent with the stooges is immediately apparent. There is also a wisdom in his words. Although a man of few words as a song-writer, Iggy Pop has a wealth of wisdom and knowledge in story telling through references to art, pop-culture, film, and TV.

Jarmusch, similarly, carries with him a sort of wisdom. It's clear, both from the film and the brief Q and A after, that he found Iggy and the Stooges at a formative stage in life. I would've loved to see more of Jarmusch's personal relationship with the music and the band on screen.
