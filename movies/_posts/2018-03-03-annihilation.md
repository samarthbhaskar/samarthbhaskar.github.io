Natalie Portman's ability to carry a film, if ever in doubt, is undeniable after <em>Annihilation</em> and <em><a href="https://letterboxd.com/samarthbhaskar/film/jackie-2016/">Jackie</a></em>. She has proven herself an adept vehicle for emotionality, action, story and transporting a character on a journey from beginning to end. 

Alex Garland's <em><a href="https://letterboxd.com/samarthbhaskar/film/ex-machina-2014/">Ex Machina</a></em> was an impressive film, and made me consider him a promising new voice in the genre. <em>Annihilation</em>, arriving on the heals of last year's excellent <em>Arrival</em>, had some of the same high points that <em>Ex Machina</em> had, including set design, photography, an unfolding story, well paced over the run time, a fascinating premise that feels like it pays off for the most part. 

But this film had a less than satisfying third act, choosing to go in a direction of "what exactly happens? What does it mean?" which didn't feel well earned. Especially the final shot that reuses a horror trope, making the film feel much less fresh as a result.
