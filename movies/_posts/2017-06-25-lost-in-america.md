If you start a movie with someone trying to fall asleep, listening to talk radio, about film criticism, you've already got a fan in me. Albert Brooks' <em>Lost in America</em> is a partially baked film about capitalism, ambition, middle and upper-middle class angst, and modern existential dread, in the shape of a comedy with a few set pieces that work really well, but without an ending. 

Modern capitalism, it turns out, is holistic and inescapable. Dropping out of society, as attractive a fantasy as it may be at times, is by and large an impossible thing to accomplish in the world we've built.
