If I ever get "cancelled" it'll be because there's a video of me, somewhere on the internet, drunkenly recounting the entirety of <em>Rush Hour</em>, word for word, and doing some awful accents along the way. I would just like to clarify: I understand that's a bad move. And not that it excuses anything, but it's purely because I deeply love this movie.
