Young women, throughout history, have provided great fodder for horror for society. It seems families, governments, religion, men in power, everyone is willing to go as far as necessary to keep young women under strict control. And yet, for centuries, young women have chipped and gnawed their way into adulthood. Grabbing what little power they can. Surviving and eventually thriving. 

<em>The Witch</em> is brilliant, contained, precise horror. Its music, lighting, cinematography, writing, language, visual palette, acting is all in service of one thing -- one of the scariest witch stories you've ever heard. Between this film, <em>Barry</em>, and <em>Split</em>, Anya Taylor-Joy is one of my favorite young actresses working right now. She creates a complex character in both big and small moments in this film. 

One scene that stood out, to me, was a dinner scene when the family, sharing a meal, lets out some of the anger and frustration that has been building up since the opening of the film. The lighting in this scene was fantastic. And the depiction of quiet aggression between family members rang so true. Dinner tables, for families in trouble, are battlegrounds. And this dinner table saw no blood (that would come later) but many injuries.
