Although the plot of this caper comedy is outlandish and kind of politically tone deaf, no one's probably watching for Peter Falk and Alan Arkin's astute geopolitical analysis. I also didn't realize that their chemistry would work so well on screen. Especially in the first third of the film, when we are introduced to these characters and they are introduced to each other, the fast flying dialogue and hilarious antics are wonderful to see on screen. I would've loved to see an entire film just set at the first dinner table. 

This film was laugh-out-loud-funny in a way that many films from the 70s and 80s just don't manage to be after multiple decades since release.
