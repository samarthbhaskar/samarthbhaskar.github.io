 A solid political, romantic, sexual thriller. The Crying Game features great performances by Stephen Rea and Jaye Davidson, and an awful one by Forest Whitaker. The first act featured great dialog between Jodi and Fergus, but the second and third act left me wanting more of the same. 

After reading about the commotion around the twist when the film first released, it seems this film got some of the same treatment that something like The Sixth Sense received. The popular conversation focused on the twist, and that affected people's ability to judge the film on the whole. With the benefit of coming to this film much later, I strongly feel like the twist is important but not central to the film. There is plenty to like about the script, the acting and the directing. But there's also something to be disappointed in with the third act and its inability to build upon a solid foundation.
