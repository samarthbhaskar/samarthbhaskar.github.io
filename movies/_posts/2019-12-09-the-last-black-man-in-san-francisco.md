Jonathan Majors (a real highlight in this film) at one point says, "I don't know, I'm still looking for a plot" in reference to a play he's writing. That about captures one of my criticisms of the film. 

The rest of it is a beautiful, almost Wes Anderson like bildungsroman, full of beauty and emotionality rarely afforded to black men or to San Francisco. I'm glad I saw it. And I look forward to what these filmmakers and actors create next.
