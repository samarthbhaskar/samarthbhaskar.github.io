 The animation in this short was stunning. My jaw was ajar the whole time. The choice of starting the short out with a live action scene of the process of drawing was a great way to situate this short in the context of largely computer animated shorts in its genre. The short itself carries less of a plot and less weight than most others, but the craftsmanship with which it is made is abundantly present on screen and puts it right next to other nominees. I suppose the fact that it is called "Prologue" clues us in to a longer story of the young girl in the film. But a hint does not a story make.
