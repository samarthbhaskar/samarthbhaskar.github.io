As a New Wave film and as a study in how American men deal with their violent instincts, it's a Master Class of a film. There have been plenty of films focused on men and their aggression but it still seems an under developed and under theorized aspect of society. We could use some more smart minds thinking about these issues and exploring them through art, academia, journalism and so on.
