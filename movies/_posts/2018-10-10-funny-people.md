There are some dated references in this film but it largely works due to its relatable, lovable/hateable characters. As everyone says about the film, it should've ended an hour before it did, but the only part I can think of removing is the Eric Bana stuff but then he's so lovely that I guess I'd probably keep it in anyway.
