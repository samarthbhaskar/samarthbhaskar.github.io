I love this movie. Very very much.

I started my career in politics, left it for a while, and I'm back there now. So many of the dynamics present here are present in modern day American politics. The overall indictment of our electoral system, I think, is spot on. The focus on competition, rather than principles; the twin tensions of doing it for the "right reasons" but ultimately being held responsible for winning; the feeling that politics is all encompassing and possibly the only route to meaningful public service in our country; all of it is captured perfectly in swift, moving, funny, relentlessly entertaining package.

This movie brought me back to high school leadership conferences and sports meets. The dynamics of being around hundreds of other 17 and 18 year olds are captured so well here. The particularities of an all-male meetup are present, yes, but I felt many of the same dynamics in mixed conferences, too. You do end up feeling like those conferences are your whole world after a day or two together.

Also, watching this with subtitles on and seeing "<em>grunting</em>" come up as background noise made me laugh every time.
