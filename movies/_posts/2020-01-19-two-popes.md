Needs more Tom Wambsgans and Cousin Greg energy. But otherwise, a pretty good episode of SUCCESSION. "Who will get the kiss from Papa!?"

Jonathan Pryce and Anthony Hopkins scenes are very, very good. Some of the best religion and philosophy on screen conversations since <em>LÃ©on Morin, Priest</em>. The flashbacks and comparative political history were less successful. 

Fernando Meirelles clearly loves the editing room. Some of the on-the-street stuff was kinetic to the point of jarring. But it was made up for by the grandeur of the Sistine Chapel scenes.
