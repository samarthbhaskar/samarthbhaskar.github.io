Films with strong political messages often fail under the weight of their message or fall prey to moralizing more than story telling. <em>3 Generations</em> is a perfect example of this dynamic. As a story, it fails to invest fully in its characters, give them motivations that are easy to understand and follow, or build tension and drama in a cohesive way. As a visual story, it was populated by frames and photographs that you might find in a picture frame you'd buy at Target. Perfectly coifed skylines and bridges, sterile blue skies, and perfectly messy penthouses in New York.

Overall, <em>3 Generations</em> was more self-satisfied that it was a story about gender identity than it was a satisfying story about gender identity. We're well suited for more stories of this kind as we deal with gender issues in society. Here's hoping we get more stories like <em><a href="https://letterboxd.com/samarthbhaskar/film/tangerine/">Tangerine</a></em> than stories like <em>3 Generations</em>.
