M. Night Shyamalan should stick to films of this size. His ambitions match his talents well here. Bigger budget films like <em>Avatar</em> and <em>The Happening</em> just aren't as well suited for him. The pleasures of his camera tricks, framing and blocking, and suspense built through highly interior locations are better felt in films like <em>Split</em>, <em>Unbreakable</em> and, of course, <em>Sixth Sense</em>.

The treatment of mental disorders and abuse left me wanting. And some of the acting by James McAvoy, which on the whole was impressive, was too campy even for a horror film like this. But overall, I was along for the ride, rooting for Anya Taylor-Joy, and a sucker for the twist at the end.
