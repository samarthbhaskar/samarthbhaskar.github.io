I watched this movie for the first time in 2019. This is around the time when Milennials, the generation following GenX, are turning 30, crossing the invisible boundary that this movie sets up as the difference between earnest and sold out. GenX, itself, has continued its crisis of confidence and identity, through the 90s and into the new century. They've either abdicated their responsibility or never truly challenged their parents, the Boomers, for power. As a result, we have 70, 80 and 90 year olds <a href="https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2019/09/03/america-gerontocracy-problem-politics-old-politicians-trump-biden-sanders-227986">leading the world</a>. And the milennials who are truly leading the world, the Jared Kushers and the MBS's, are following models set by boomers. 

So, ultimately, I guess what I'm saying is, this movie was fine to watch. But in the context of what GenX went on to become, I couldn't help but watch it with 2019 eyes, like a prequel to a world wide car crash.
