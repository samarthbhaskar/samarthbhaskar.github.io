 As others have been noting, this is not much more than an extended Key & Peele sketch. But as any fan of their show knows, that's reason enough to show up. They mine some interesting identity issues, but never with as much acuity as some of their best sketches.

Overall, this was a good first foray into film-making. I look forward to more films from Key and Peele in the future.
