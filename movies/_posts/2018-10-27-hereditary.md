[LetterboxD review link](https://letterboxd.com/samarthbhaskar/film/hereditary/)

Every time I review a horror film on Letterboxd, I have to include the caveat that this genre is tough for me. But the few horror films I've shown up for in the last few years (<em>The Witch</em>, <em>It Follows</em>, <em>It Comes At Night</em> and <em>Get Out</em>) have been among my favorites of those years. 

<em>Hereditary</em> was, similarly, a memorable movie in 2018. I watched it at home, threw squinted eyes, and tightened muscles throughout. Toni Collette's performance is truly as remarkable as everyone says it is. And the storyline here is much more complicated an over-wrought than most other horror movies of its ilk. Anyway, its a good movie, I'm exhausted just thinking about it.
