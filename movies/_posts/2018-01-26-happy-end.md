Michael Haneke is a masterful director, if for no other reason, because of his preternatural skill at tone management. This film, although not as ambitious, and a somewhat minor work in his filmography, makes some successful attempts at dealing with the effects of technology in our lives. It is much more successful, though, at what Haneke has always been good at exploring: families, dynamics between men, women and children, and the deep existential loneliness of living in the world, surrounded by people.

Haneke also draws out amazing performances from this ensemble cast. I couldn't help but think, though, how impressive it is that Jean-Louis Tringtignant is still so good at his job at 80 years old. I can't imagine being as good at something at 80 as I was at 20. What an impressive actor.
