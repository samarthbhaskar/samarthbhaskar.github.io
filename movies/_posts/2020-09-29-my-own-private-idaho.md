[LetterboxD review link](https://letterboxd.com/samarthbhaskar/film/my-own-private-idaho/)

Like <em><a href="https://letterboxd.com/samarthbhaskar/film/american-honey/">American Honey</a></em>, this film succeeds as a road movie but also as a slice of life of a particular kind of American young adult bristling at the life they are supposed to live. Unlike, <em>American Honey</em>, though, <em>Idaho</em> is much more successful on the backs of River Phoenix and Keanu Reeves's acting. Everything I see from Gus Van Sant leaves me more and more impressed. He should be counted among the best of 20th century American film makers.
