<em>Sing Street</em>, much like its older sibling <em>Once</em>, succeeds largely because of the quality of its music. It draws from 80's pop and rock, and is a great introduction or reminiscence of the discographies of bands like The Cure, The Smiths, Duran Duran and David Bowie. If it wasn't for the high quality musicality, this movie would be much less enjoyable.

The other key ingredient in this film is its lead, Ferdia Walsh-Peelo. He is able to manage dynamics of emotions asked of his character, with openness, charisma and confidence. This mix of emotionality and conviction serves his character and the ethos of the film well. 

<em>Once</em> had better story-telling, a tighter inner-world, and fewer loose ends in its plot. But <em>Sing Street</em> is no slouch in comparison.
