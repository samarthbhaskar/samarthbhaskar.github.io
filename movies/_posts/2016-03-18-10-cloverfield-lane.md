[LetterboxD review link](http://letterboxd.com/samarthbhaskar/film/10-cloverfield-lane/)

 I've read a few reviews that start with "don't read anything about this film, see it context free first." Thankfully, I read these reviews after seeing <em>10 Cloverfield Lane</em>. Even the fantastic, faux montage trailer, which I saw after the film was much better post-viewing than it would've been before. I never saw the first <em>Cloverfield</em> but I don't think it was my kind of film. Thankfully, this film has little to nothing to do with the first. It merely uses the <em>Cloverfield</em> branding as a jumping off point. 

<em>10 Cloverfield Lane</em> is a self-contained entertainment capsule. It doesn't reach too far beyond its grasp, it paces things, including a great montage, a couple of important reveals and a properly short final encounter sequence quite well. The sense of balance, coupled with good acting (John Goodman can do no wrong in my book, though) makes for a good time. I don't think this will be a memorable film, but not every film has to be.

I was excited to see Damien Chazelle's name come up during credits. Not that I have much to go off besides <em>Whiplash</em>, but his influence seemed minimal on this script. Regardless, I'm gunning for more writing credits for him.
