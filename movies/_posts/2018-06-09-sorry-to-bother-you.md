Ironically, much like Marxism and Marx's writings, its the ending that sort of makes the whole thing not work. The ending aside, this film was a bright, biting, hilarious satire. Lakeith Stanfield is one of the best actors working on screen (big and small) today. Tessa Thompson was woefully underutilized but when she was on screen, she was great. 

Boots Riley, unlike many other artists working with satire or irony these days, has the crucial missing piece: something to say beyond making fun of how things work in society. He's got a point of view and he's not shy about it.
