I'm in Hong Kong for work this week, and as a long time Hong Kong cinema fan, I wanted to make time for a movie. This was the one that made sense given my schedule.

It's nothing to write home about (although that's kind of what I'm doing now, huh) but the action was well directed. Tony Jaa is kind of getting old, but he's still got it.

I did enjoy the experience of seeing a Chinese film in Hong Kong. It's fun to see cinema culture around the world.
