I can't remember where this movie was mentioned that it came across my radar, but I added it to my Watchlist and pulled it up the other night. And then, bam, a couple of my former coworkers made small appearances! Which was kind of mind blowing when it happened. 

Overall, it was a really enjoyable mumble-core film. The late gen-X, early millennial repetitive use of "I don't know," "um" and "I'm sorry" is used to perfection.
