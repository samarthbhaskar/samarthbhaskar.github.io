Boy, Nora Ephron could really write a movie. This movie really is a once-in-a-decade genre-defining film, like <em>Annie Hall</em>. Unfortunately, I do think it will now contend with <em><a href="https://letterboxd.com/samarthbhaskar/film/phantom-thread/">Phantom Thread</a></em> for the all time best New Year's Eve film.
