There's something interesting about considering each <em>Star Wars</em> trilogy as emblamatic of popular cinema of its era. If we take that to be true, <em>The Last Jedi</em> and the <em>The Force Awakens</em>, and even <em>Rogue One</em> to some extent, remind me of Marvel movies of the late 2000s and 2010s. The script and characterization is largely moving from set piece to set piece, and everything seems to be in service of an action sequence. 

Admittedly, I don't know enough about the other Star Wars trilogies to fully make this argument but it's something I found myself thinking about. Maybe if I catch up with the other trilogies more fully, I can come back and consider this critique again.
