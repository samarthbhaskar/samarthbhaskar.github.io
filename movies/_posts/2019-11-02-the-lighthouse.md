A man vs nature vs man vs bird vs machine vs himself parable that will ultimately be more memorable for its parts than its whole. There were plenty of interesting themes and ideas but not enough of a story to hang those themes onto. 

I was, though, reminded of 2012's <em><a href="https://letterboxd.com/samarthbhaskar/film/leviathan-2012/">Leviathan</a></em>, which is still a singular movie experience I have never been able to replicate since. I still feel a pang of fear when I think of it.
