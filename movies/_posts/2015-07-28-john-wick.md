[LetterboxD review link](http://letterboxd.com/samarthbhaskar/film/john-wick/)

 I don't want to elevate this film next to some of the 4 and 5-star reviews I've given on this site, but the 3-star review might not convey how much I enjoyed this film. It is deceptively simple. It succeeds because of its restraint.
