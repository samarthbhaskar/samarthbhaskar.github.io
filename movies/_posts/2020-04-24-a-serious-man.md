Accidentally paired this with a rewatch of <em>Uncut Gems</em> in the same day, during the pandemic. And they're both fantastic films for our time. "I didn't do anything" is a perfect refrain for the helplessness I've been feeling. And the world seems to be feeling around us. 

And the themes here about religion, rationality, cursedness, responsibility and so much more are enough to feel both triggering and like a balm.
