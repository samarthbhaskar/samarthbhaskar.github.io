Airplane re-watch.

I used to watch this movie over and over again when I was a kid. If I'm being honest, it probably had something to do with the fact that it was one of few movies we owned on VHS. And I knew exactly how far into the movie the cake scene was.

Re-watching it recently, I found the geopolitical, post-cold war, Reagan-era nationalism tones interesting. Not that the film indulges them too much, but even the subtext as motivating premise was interesting to consider. It wasn't long, though, before the film moved on from these motivations to Steven Seagal's hammy acting and knife-fighting. And Tommy Lee Jones having maybe the most fun he's had on screen until he played Two Face. And Gary Busey, well, in a dress.
