 If you can help it, try going in to <em>Tickled</em> with two things: (1) only view the trailer and (2) view, read, listen to nothing else about it. Knowing very little about this film really pays off. 

There are some parts, especially the middle third, that drag. Some elements, like the slow-motion, music-laden, <em>Jiro Dreams of Sushi</em>-esque montages, feel derivative, but they sort of work in bringing some diversity to the tone of the film. And overall, you're not going to find much adventure in the film-making. But the subject and the story alone take this film a long way.
