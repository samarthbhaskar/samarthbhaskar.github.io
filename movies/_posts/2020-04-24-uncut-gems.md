A rewatch after my only watch in the theaters last year. Although I feel like I consumed about 4 weeks worth of content around this film when it came out (and enjoyed all of it), I somehow missed this fantastic <a href="https://jewishcurrents.org/an-unserious-man/">roundtable in Jewish Currents</a>, which situates the film, Howard Ratner and Adam Sandler in modern Judaism. It might now be my favorite piece of commentary or criticism about this film. Followed shortly, of course, by all the NBA content and commentary. 

What a film.
