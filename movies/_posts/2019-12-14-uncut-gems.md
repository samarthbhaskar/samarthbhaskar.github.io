The Safdie's have made an incredible sports movie. An elevated horror film. An aggressively New York film. And 2019's second best film about a cursed rock that shows up in act one and relentlessly ruins everyone's life. 

I left the theater buzzing. And wanted to yell, as Kevin Garnett did after winning the 2008 finals, "ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE!!!"
