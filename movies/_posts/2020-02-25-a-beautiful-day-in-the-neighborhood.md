As good a reason as any to re-read the wonderful Tom Junod <a href="https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/tv/a27134/can-you-say-hero-esq1198/">profile</a> from which this movie stems. And as good a reason as any, to celebrate great magazine profile writing, which is thankfully something of a resurgent art these days.
