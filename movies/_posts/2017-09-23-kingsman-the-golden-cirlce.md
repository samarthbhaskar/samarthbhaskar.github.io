<em>Kingsman</em>, the first film in this series, caught me by surprise. I wasn't expecting to enjoy it as much as I did. The action was crisp and felt fresh. The story had interesting social commentary involved. And then the final scene threw a lot of what it had earned down the toilet, with what seemed like a throw-away line about sex, but betrayed the film as juvenille and immature and masculine in a way that I thought it wasn't.

This sequel, it seems, picked up right where that film left off. There's hardly anything redeemable in it, save perhaps for Julianne Moore's performance. I would love to see more unhinged stuff from her, basically the exact opposite of something like <em>Still Alice</em>. You can bring back Colin Firth from the dead. You can call up Channing Tatum, Halle Berry and Jeff Bridges. But that's not going to save your story from itself if you have little or nothing compelling to say to begin with.
