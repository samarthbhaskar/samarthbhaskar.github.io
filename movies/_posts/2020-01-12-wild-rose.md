Tasha Robinson picked this as one of her favorites of the year on <a href="https://www.filmspotting.net/episodes-archive/2019/12/27/758-pt-1-top-10-films-of-2019">Filmspotting Best of 2019 Part 1</a>, and besides Jessie Buckley's performance, I cannae understand why.

I would've loved more musical performances, at least as many as <em>Sing Street</em>. And a modern depiction of class relations, instead of one plucked from the 1950s. But between this, Kacey Musgraves, and <em><a href="https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/dolly-partons-america">Dolly Parton's America</a></em>, country (not country & western) is making a solid play for modern hearts.
