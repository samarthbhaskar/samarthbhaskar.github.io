Russell Crowe and Ryan Gosling make this a better movie than it is. Shane Black's origin as a writer, or perhaps the mixing of writing and directing, creates a convoluted, unclear feeling throughout the film. Although the neo-noir genre requires some suspension of disbelief, there isn't enough other stuff to bring this movie together. As a viewer, I was mostly left lost and unsure.

I liked <em>Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang</em> when it came out, and that too benefited from Robert Downey Jr.'s charisma. But unfortunately charisma wasn't enough to bring this movie over the edge.
