Wiseman has an uncanny ability to calmly, quietly, get you to watch calmness and quietness on screen. He doesn't badger you into caring about what he thinks you should care about; you just get there somehow. He knows how to take you out of modern life while commenting on modern life.

The kinds of themes running throughout this film about the digital revolution and its effects on knowledge-based institutions is familiar to me and a running theme in my professional work for the past few years. There's something about seeing it depicted on screen, though, that had a cloying effect on me. In a number of the scenes featuring the leadership team, there's a woman who has a senior role who has to chime in every time. And the majority of the time, she either just restates what's already been said in different words. Or adds a completely off topic point. I recognized so many of my coworkers in her. And it kind of drove me insane. 

Anyway, that's all beside the point of this documentary. Which, I suppose if it had <em>A</em> point would be that we a owe a debt of gratitude to libraries as convening places, open, inviting, helping solve all manner of problems and democratizing information.
