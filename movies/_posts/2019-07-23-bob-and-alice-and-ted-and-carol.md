<em>Bob & Carol & Ted & Alice</em> is a transition movie. It is about the transition from the sexual politics of the 50s into the sexual politics of the 60s. And about the salvation that didn't come. In some ways, it is a very conservative movie. Or at least a very reactionary movie. It poses the question: "what if we all talked about our feelings and were incredibly generous to one another," and answers it with: "we'll continue to feel as empty and lost as before."
