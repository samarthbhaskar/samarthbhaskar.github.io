Along with <em><a href="https://letterboxd.com/samarthbhaskar/film/dangal/">Dangal</a></em>, one of the better mainstream Bollywood films of the last decade. Although in terms of affect, I think the emotional quality of this film can be summarily captured in one anecdote: one of the real life rappers on whom this film is built is called Naezy, which stands for "Naveed is crazy."
