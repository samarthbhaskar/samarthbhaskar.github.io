 Saw this over the weekend at MoMA screening. It was a nice change of venue that elevated this already stratospheric film. I don't think I can write about this film critically, mostly because I just enjoyed it so much. And also because I don't think I can find much wrong about it.

I also liked watching this after joining the iconic journalistic enterprise of my time. It brought the film down to earth, for me. Journalism, at least how it is practiced now, is a pretty uniquely American endeavor and Kane captures the aspirations and faults of the industry quite well.
