[LetterboxD review link](https://letterboxd.com/samarthbhaskar/film/non-fiction/)

I don't know a lot of Olivier Assayas's filmography, mostly only <em><a href="https://letterboxd.com/samarthbhaskar/film/personal-shopper/">Personal Shopper</a></em> and <em><a href="https://letterboxd.com/samarthbhaskar/film/clouds-of-sils-maria/"></a>Clouds of Sils Maria</em>, both of which I love. I look forward to catching up with more of it soon.

I knew <em>Non Fiction</em> was something different, a film less reliant on some of the mysticism of <em>Shopper</em> and <em>Clouds</em>, but I wasn't expecting such a delightful mumblecore, talky, angst-about-middle-age film. Despite the fact that there was a "head of Digital Transition," pretty prominently featured in the film as the cause of some of this anxiety (which hit a little too close to home since that's also my job title), I enjoyed spending a couple of hours with these characters. 

At different points in my life, I probably would've reacted differently to these characters. As a teenager, I might have thought, "wow, they have such cool lives. I hope when I'm older, I'm as literate and intellectual as them." As a 20-something, "wow, these people are pretentious and exhausting. I hope I've grown out of behaving like this by the time I'm in middle age." Now, it's probably something like, "uh oh, be careful, that management consultant who went to business school is probably going to run your company into the ground!"
