A rewatch with Elise. <em>The Invitation</em> is a great example of a chamber piece that maintains the viewer's ability to know exactly where you are the whole time, which can be a difficult task to accomplish. There's also a lot to be said about the level of suspense that Kusama is able to create and how much above its weight class this movie punches.
