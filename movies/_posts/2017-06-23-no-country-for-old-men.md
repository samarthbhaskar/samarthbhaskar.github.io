[LetterboxD review link](https://letterboxd.com/samarthbhaskar/film/no-country-for-old-men/)

A rewatch on an airplane back from Europe. 

This is a perfect film. Perfectly directed. With performances that sail off the screen and into the psyche. Sound design, cinematography, and technical details that are massively impressive. And a story that burrows into your brain on emotional and intellectual levels.
