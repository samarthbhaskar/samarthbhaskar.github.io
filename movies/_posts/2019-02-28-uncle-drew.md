I honestly could not have come into this movie a more favorable viewer. An NBA apologist, a sucker for sports celebrity, and an avid viewer of YouTube skits from Late Night shows, I really thought I would like almost anything they strung together for this movie.

But it was just so bad, that I could feel my good will leaving my body as I watched this film.
