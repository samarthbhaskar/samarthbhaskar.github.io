There's a large painting of a pond squarely framed at the beginning of the film, and a couple more times in its runtime. I wondered what this pond meant as the film was starting. By the end of it, I was convinced that it represented the depth of feeling and love that exists in this family. And the depth of emotion that Lulu Wang drew upon in making this film. 

<em>The Farewell</em> was one of, if not my favorite, movie going experience in 2019 so far.
