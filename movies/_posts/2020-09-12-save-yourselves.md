The local drive-in was playing a screening of this film the other night. So we thought we'd take an escapist little trip to see a movie about a mixed Indian-White couple, from Brooklyn, who spend a lot of time together, as the world crumbles around them. As one of the few movie-going experiences of 2020, I think we made a bad choice.

But as a fun movie with charming lead performances by Sunita Mani and John Reynolds that we enjoyed from the safety of a car while eating tacos we picked up on the way there, not bad!
