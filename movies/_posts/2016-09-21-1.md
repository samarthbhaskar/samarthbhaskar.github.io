[LetterboxD review link](http://letterboxd.com/samarthbhaskar/film/the-martian/1/)

 A re-watch on HBONow after about a year. My earlier review now comes off (it probably always came off) as pompous. But I stand by it. This is a highly entertaining film that takes none of the inner life of its protagonist seriously.
