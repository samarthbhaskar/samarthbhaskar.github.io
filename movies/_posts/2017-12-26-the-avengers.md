A rewatch with friends over the holidays. This film makes for good mindless entertainment that you can tune in and out of. But having seen <em><a href="https://letterboxd.com/samarthbhaskar/film/thor-ragnarok/">Thor Ragnarok</a></em> recently, Loki becomes much less believable and scary as a super villain.
