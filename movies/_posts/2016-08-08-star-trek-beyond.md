 I was pretty disengaged the whole time. The story felt a bit "lol nothing matters." The acting was fine. For some reason, the action sequences and even some of the regular shots were very dark, making it hard to follow what was happening on screen.

I did chuckle at the futuristic metro stations. Which look exactly like the Dubai metro stations first built in like 2009-2010.
