Pixar did it again. The world building and rules stuff got a little bit tiresome, especially when new stuff was introduced 10 minutes before the end of the film, but it all basically worked for me. I'm not sure there's much in this movie for kids, but I'd be happy to be proven wrong. 

Some of the depictions of being "in the zone" and the best qualities of meditation (when you feel like you're grabbing consciousness by the thinnest string but you're actually floating somewhere else) were depicted and described here better than almost anything I've ever read or seen. Kudos to Pete Docter and the whole team on this one.

(On a sour note: Jon Batiste seems like a very nice person but his music is utterly forgettable. The credits featured some other great heavy hitters, though.)
