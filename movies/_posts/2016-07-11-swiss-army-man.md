 <em>Swiss Army Man</em> deserves accolades for its fresh premise and a novel idea upon which the filmmakers set out to create a story. The focus on on the corporeal, the exploration of Hank's id as a brought-back-to-life corpse, the relationship between our physical selves and our self-aware cognition; these are all fertile areas of exploration. Combined with the Michel Gondry or Spike Jones'-esque film-making, the montages set to indie acappella music, solid acting on the part of both the protagonists, this movie should've landed more solidly than it did.

Ultimately, the third act doesn't congeal, there's no real take home message about the core thesis (the relationship between bodily and non-bodily life) and what started as lean-forward-in-your-seat premise ends up a lean-back-and-throw-your-hands-up ending.

Paul Dano, although good in this movie, has already done some of this manic pixie dream girl/guy stuff in <em>Ruby Sparks</em>. In fact, I was very interested in the exploration of the undertones of homosexuality in this film, but even that avenue never really paid off.
