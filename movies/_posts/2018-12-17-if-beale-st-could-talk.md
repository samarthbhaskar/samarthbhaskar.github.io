Many parts of <em>If Beale Street Could Talk</em> reminded me of <em>In The Mood For Love</em>, one of my favorite films of all time. But no element made me think of Wong Kar-Wai's classic romantic drama more than the score. The feeling this score elicits is similar to the score of <em>Mood</em>. For the rest of my life, I could hear even 2 notes from either of these scores, and I would stop cold, and be transported directly into either story.

In a Q&A after this film, Barry Jenkins described taking a writing trip to Europe during which he wrote both <em>Moonlight</em> and <em>Beale Street</em>. This fact blew my mind. I can think of few periods of time more fertile in any contemporary artist's life. I'm so glad I'm an adult in the same time period that Barry Jenkins is making films.
