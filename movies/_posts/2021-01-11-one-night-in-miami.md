We rented a theater for $25 for a family viewing, marking this as the first movie I've seen in a theater in more than 9 months. What a trip this last year has been.

Leslie Odom Jr and Kingsley Ben-Adir are remarkably talented men. The music sequences with Odom singing were too short. And the movie really came alive when any two of the four were engaging in a dialog. At other times, the constraints of its stage origins are apparent. But the central themes: what responsibility do you have as an icon, what pressures you must feel when you're a person and much more than that, who gets to choose the path he walks down all felt both timely and timeless.
