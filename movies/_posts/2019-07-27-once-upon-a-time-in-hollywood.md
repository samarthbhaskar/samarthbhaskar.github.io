Tarantino's exploration of late middle-age was too nostalgia (no longer a politically impotent emotion) laden for my liking. Transitional eras (TV to movies now back toward TV), the importance of the people-behind-the-scenes, and another excercise in counterfactual history were all themes I could get behind. But they don't come together into a compelling story. Film nostalgia is part of all of Tarantino's films but none of his other films are solely <em>about</em> film nostalgia.

There are great scenes and sequences, especially the finale, but overall the film was not much more than a hangout film. Tarantino is a talented film maker but this one just didn't have enough of a raison d'etre to hang together for me.
