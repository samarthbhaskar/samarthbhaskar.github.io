<em>Kong: Skull Island</em> is, as someone here on Letterbox described it, a pastiche of images and homages to Vietnam era films. But made for a modern audience. The <em>Heart of Darkness</em> moralizing about what makes an enemy an enemy also felt trite. The monkey and lizard fighting scenes were fine, but also derivative of other major battle scenes, like <em>The Hulk</em> or recent <em>Godzilla</em> outings.
