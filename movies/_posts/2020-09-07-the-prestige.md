In my mind, the prototypical Nolan film and among his best. Until he got distracted with the spectacle of cinema stuff and got hell bent on time instead of story as the organizing principle. Most of the subsequent Nolan films should be Netflix mini-series. This is a well-told, well-made 2-hour story.

A great depiction of one of the core Nolan story traits, too: that it is actually the Nolan brothers we should talk about. Not just Chris Nolan.
