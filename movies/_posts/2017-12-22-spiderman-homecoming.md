[LetterboxD review link](https://letterboxd.com/samarthbhaskar/film/spider-man-homecoming/1/)

A rewatch over the holidays, with family. After a handful of not-that-great superhero movies, this one really shines in contrast. And although <em><a href="https://letterboxd.com/samarthbhaskar/film/wonder-woman-2017/">Wonder Woman</a></em> was a worthy outing from Marvel, films like <em>Spider-Man: Homecoming</em> clearly show how much of a gap there is between the MCU and whatever DC is putting out.
