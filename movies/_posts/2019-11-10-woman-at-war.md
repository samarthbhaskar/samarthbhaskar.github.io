Add it to the list of great films about climate change, like <em><a href="https://letterboxd.com/samarthbhaskar/film/first-reformed/">First Reformed</a></em>, but tonally basically the opposite. 

There's also something prosaic about the Icelandic setting: an island nation, "western" by every measure, a long rapacious history, the other-worldly landscape and scenery. It all comes together beautifully on screen.
