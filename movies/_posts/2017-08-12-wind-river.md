Taylor Sheridan has been on my radar recently, especially after <em><a href="https://letterboxd.com/samarthbhaskar/film/sicario-2015/">Sicario</a></em> and <em><a href="https://letterboxd.com/samarthbhaskar/film/hell-or-high-water/">Hell or High Water</a></em>, both of which were very well written, and the first executed more successfully than the second. I was surprised, then, to see that Taylor Sheridan had a new film, which had written and directed, that I didn't hear anything about until it was released this week. My interest was piqued when I saw his name attached.

Sheridan is definitely a talented director. In fact, his directing and writing are well-matched. He can't, yet, elevate his writing like Denis Villeneuve could. But that's hardly anything to complain about. Villeneuve is one of the best directors working in the industry today. 

This film, although it sags somewhat in the 2nd act, is a compelling entry to a tried and tested genre. Sheridan's commitment to setting his stories in places like Texas and Wyoming, and filling them with characters who are often mythologized in Americana, but updating them with modern problems and temperaments is fascinating. As we see a resurgence of interest in stories about these parts of America, I look forward to more work from Sheridan in this vein. Although, I'd be very interested to see if he can be as successful writing and directing a non-action or non-thriller with the same type of didactic, moral/ethical approach.
