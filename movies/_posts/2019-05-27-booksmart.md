A highly enjoyable, almost perfect, high school movie. I'm hard pressed to think of anythign I didn't like. If I had to think of something: it became slightly tiresome to see so many crowded, close-up frames. I suppose that's the nature of phone/instagram framing anyway and mirrors the its-all-about-me-ness of high school.
