<em>Moonstruck</em> is a lovely 80s romantic comedy, in which a character takes a $25 cab ride from JFK to Brooklyn Heights. Cher and Nicholas Cage put in great performances, as do some of the supporting cast. The depiction of a tight-knit Italian immigrant family and Italian working and middle-class Brooklyn are delightful. 

I found it fascinating to see an Italian immigrant family, a generation or maybe even half-a-generation into their American lives, living in a context that was so beautifully Italian-American. It made me wonder, what a Mexican-American or Asian-American of a movie like this might be in 20 or 30 years, when (or if) any of those groups are allowed to become white the way Italians were in the middle of the 20th century. 

I also thought a lot about fidelity and monogamy during this movie and found its treatment of the complications of marriage and love a refreshing addition to a genre that usually treats those things as table stakes.
