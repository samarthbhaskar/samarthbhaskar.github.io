 <em>Maggie's Plan</em> should be shown at the beginning of grad school as a story about how not to be an academic. The main academic characters in the film are insufferable. They are self-involved, unable to see or learn from the people around them and wholly convinced that their genius is worth other people's hard work to take care of them. Please don't be a person or an academic like this, no matter how much of a genius you are.

As a film, <em>Maggie's Plan</em> is mostly funny, at times warm but largely confused, meandering and unsure of itself. Rebecca Miller may have struck gold, though, by portraying Greta Gerwig as a midwesterner. Her affect and temperament is perfectly midwestern and now I'm going to have a hard time imagining any of her characters as anything but.
