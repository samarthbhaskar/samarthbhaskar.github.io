<em>Alien: Covenant</em> continues what <em>Prometheus</em> started. And is more like <em>Prometheus</em> than like the earlier <em>Alien</em> films. If the earlier films in this series were mostly horror movies. <em>Prometheus</em> was more action but still a lot of philosophizing. And <em>Covenant</em> is even more of a conventional action movie. In so far as action movies are concerned, I don't think this is a highly successful one. But as far as sci-fi, mythical, modern philosophizing, action-packed fairy tells about creation and free will go, this was a pretty good film.

Ridley Scott is a highly practical film maker. His background as a ad director probably has a lot to do with that. Every interview I see with him, not to mention works like <em><a href="https://letterboxd.com/samarthbhaskar/film/the-martian/">The Martian</a></em>, show clearly that he's a pragmatic man, chiefly concerned with finding a way to make things work. In all his pragmatism, he has realized that the source of energy for these movies is no longer the Aliens themselves, but characters like David/Walter. He has deftly transitioned the series and relied on great performances by Michael Fassbender to keep breathing life into this story. As a pragmatist myself, I believe in the iterative approach to improvement. With each film in this series, Scott is trying something new, learning, and refining. He found a few things that worked in <em>Prometheus</em> and he embellished on those themes here. I imagine he'll find some new stuff from this film that he'll use for the next iteration.
