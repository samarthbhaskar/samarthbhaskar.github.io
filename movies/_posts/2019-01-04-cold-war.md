[LetterboxD review link](https://letterboxd.com/samarthbhaskar/film/cold-war-2018/)

Like <em>ROMA</em>, <em>Cold War</em> features stark, beautiful, photography. Every frame is worth freezing and looking at at length. However, unlike <em>ROMA</em>, which felt like a novel turned into a film, this film feels like a short story turned into a film. The interrogations of its characters, the journey they go on, and where they end up all feel like they got short shrift.

Joanna Kulig, though, is a revelation. A Polish Jennifer Lawrence, who I hope does not go down some of the same paths in terms of artistic choices as JLaw. (this is not me trying to police JLaw's choices, it's just me lamenting like I have elsewhere on LetterboxD that I wish for more <em>Winter's Bone</em> type stuff from her.)
