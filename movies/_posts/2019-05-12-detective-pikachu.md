This is the film you get when a generation of young men are raised by Pok√©mon and have unresolved feelings about their fathers. And, honestly, in comparison to becoming Gamergate-types, this is a much better outcome. 

Also, why is Milo Yiannopoulos a central character? And revealed to be a fraud? Is this the first alt right movie of our times?
