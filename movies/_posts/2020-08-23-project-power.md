I used to watch every Casey Neistat YouTube upload, for about 2 years straight. I don't know what was so compelling about his vlogging, but it really captured me for a while. I remember when he went to shoot this movie in New Orleans. All the secrecy and blurred pixels. Ironically, the producers who hired him for this movie because of his cache as an influencer, probably couldn't have predicted that he'd basically leave YouTube and would be way out of date as an internet celebrity by the time the life cycle of this movie was complete. The pill, it seems, really does only last for about 5 minutes.
