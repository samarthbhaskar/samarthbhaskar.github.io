Kind of crazy that this, <em>Spotlight</em> and <em>Two Popes</em> are basically the best movies about decades (centuries?) long abuse in the catholic church. There have to be more stories out there that deserve to be told to broad audiences. But maybe its just too traumatic a topic to treat that way.
