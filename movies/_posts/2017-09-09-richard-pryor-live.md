Pryor -- the comedian's comedian -- is, without question, the funniest man in modern comedy. This special is a case study in impersonation, and his use of voice and characterization. Every voice, even the smallest, throw-away one, feels like a fully built character. His comedy is smart but not hyper-intellectual. His delivery is fast and fluid but not breakneck speed. His observations are keen but not philosophical or complex. But when you put the whole package together, and add his charisma and talent, is unbeatable.
