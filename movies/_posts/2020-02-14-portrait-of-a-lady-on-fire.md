I don't know how to coherently capture how perfect a film this is, so here's a list of blurted out thoughts after seeing this and not being able to yell about how perfect it is for days:

1. Every line of dialog is as perfect as the sound of charcoal hitting canvas.
2. Every frame is perfectly composed.
3. Every musical cue and use of music sucked the air out from inside me.
4. The depiction of the friendship between the three female characters who spend most of the film on screen together is perfect.
5. The colors, costumes, set design, sound design, cinematography, directing, every technical detail is perfect but also full of emotion. In another year, it would be this film not <em>1917</em> that would be languished with praise for technical mastery.
6. I don't know what else to say: it's a perfect film.
