The Austin of <em>Mr Roosevelt</em> doesn't feel all that much different from the Austin of <em>Slackers</em>. There are some new taco trucks and coffee shops, but it's still the Velvet Rut and fine with it. The casting choices in this film help capture some of these qualities, as do some of the party and house scenes.

Overall, though, the story NoÃ«l Wells tells in <em>Mr Roosevelt</em>, I've seen a few times in the last few years. Not that that, alone, makes it uninteresting. I just didn't find too much new in what Wells added to the genre. Some scenes, some dialog, some character flaws were new and interesting. The movie was enjoyable, like a hot, sunny, afternoon near the water in Texas.
