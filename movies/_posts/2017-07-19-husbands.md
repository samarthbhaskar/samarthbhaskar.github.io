<em>Husbands</em>, like many of John Cassavetes' films, is unrelenting in its presentation of masculinity. In this film, in particular, masculinity, freedom, life and meaning are all explored. Unfortunately, they are explored in a faux-cinéma vérité film making style, with (seemingly) a lot of improvisation that seems to be hiding deeper writing flaws. The scenes that work, work very well. They're funny. They reveal fascinating things about the characters (while the actors try their best not to get in their own ways). Camera and editing choices seem to reflect the kind of masculinity these character are supposed to embody: frenetic, insular, cramped and non-committal. Male-ness, for 1970s upper middle class suburban men is, in interesting ways, much the same and much different from male-ness today. But it certainly shares the fact that it is built on shaky foundations.
