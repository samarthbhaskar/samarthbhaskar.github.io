I wish to spend as little time as possible talking or thinking about this movie. I also wish I could receive the time I spent watching this movie back. This is the dumb man's thinking movie. 

I need to go rewatch <em>Her</em>, <em>The Master</em> and <em>Signs</em> to clear the taste of this Phoenix performance from my mouth.
