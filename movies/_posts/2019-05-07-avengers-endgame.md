Incorporating characters, stories and source material from 20+ movies, while still coming up with a somewhat interesting story line that balances the complexity of good and evil and doesn't downplay the weight of either is commendable. But, boy, it was tiring to sit through character after character exercising their emotionality and getting full due on screen.
