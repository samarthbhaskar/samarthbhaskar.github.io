 Here is an incomplete list of things that I was thinking about while watching <em>Kubo and the Two Strings</em>:

- children dealing with parents with mental health issues
- children dealing with grandparents with memory loss, alzheimer's or other neurological or degenerative diseases
- generational conflict. Namely, the kind of thing that is happening around the world lately, politically. Where older generations are trying to hang on to the world they knew, while younger generations are fighting for power to change the world into something new. 
- the power of stories and narrative in our lives. How stories help us make sense of life, which can otherwise just be a stream of events with no clear starts, middles or ends.
- a couple of quotes, which I seem to have mixed up in my memory, but which go something like "we are the stories we tell ourselves, so we must be careful what stories we tell ourselves"

Overall, <em>Kubo and the Two Strings</em> is chock full of these themes and plot ideas. These ideas are carried in a deceptively traditional journey-centric fable, which can at times feel less ambitious than the ideas it is trying to convey. But combined with beautiful, sharp animation, this becomes a memorable film experience.
