It succeeds in tone as much as it fails in pacing and story telling. Save for the finale, which despite the fact that I was looking for it, worked for me anyway. 

Pankaj Mishra's <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_Anger">Age of Anger</a></em>, a 2017 nonfiction book about the outsized role young, fragile, violent men play in our political imagination, is one of the most underappreciated stories of our era. This film gets at some of those themes: loneliness, hypermasculinity, violence, delinquency. But falls short of exploring them in any meaningful way.
