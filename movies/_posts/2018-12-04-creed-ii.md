What Ryan Coogler started with the CREED franchise (reclaiming and updating the ROCKY franchise and rightfully placing a black protagonist at its center), CREED II only marginally advanced. In its writing, directing, and acting (especially Florian Munteanu), it fails to capture the magic that made CREED stand apart from most other films. I still enjoyed CREED II as a movie-going experience, if for no other reason than to see Michael B. Jordan and Tessa Thompson's chemistry on screen. And some well orchestrated fight scenes.
