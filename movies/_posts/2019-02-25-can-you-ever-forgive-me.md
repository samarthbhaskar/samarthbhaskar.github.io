At the end of 2018, many best-of-the-year lists placed this movie higher than I expected, given its reception at the time of release. So at the beginning of 2019, I finally caught up to it at home. I loved Marielle Heller's <em>The Diary of a Teenage Girl</em>, which had a deeper, darker, layer than the cover or trailer let on. I was hoping for some of the same depth here and was not dissapointed. 

Coverage of this movie has highlighted the chemistry between the two lead actors and their rapport really does jump off the screen. For a somber film, there's more here than most romantic comedies or buddy movies. 

There were some hiccups in the plot of this film, which I imagine were a result of the source material not translating well in the screenwriting process. But they were excusable given how successful almost every other element of the film is. 

I look forward to Heller's take on Mr. Rogers and what deeper layers she chooses to probe in his life.
