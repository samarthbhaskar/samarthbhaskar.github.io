Sacrifice is a major American value, especially in action movies. The last 45-minutes of this film beautifully capture the sacrifices made by its protagonists. The action is crisp. The shots are beautiful. The pacing is well calibrated.

The irony, though, is that we must first sacrifice about 80-90 minutes of preamble and set up to get this reward.
