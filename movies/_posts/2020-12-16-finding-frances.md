Bill: "Trump's the man for the presidency, I'm telling you"
Nathan: "But he's losing in the polls"
Bill: "You can't go by the polls"
Nathan: "What can you go by?"
Bill: "Election day"

...Bill needs to teach this lesson on the road to Democrats around the country. New job for you Bill.

(Also Nathan For You is arguably the best commentary on American capitalism and society produced in the last 20 years, and this might be its best episode ever.)
