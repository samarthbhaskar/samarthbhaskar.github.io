[LetterboxD review link](http://letterboxd.com/samarthbhaskar/film/terminator-2-judgment-day/)

One of, if not the singular, best sequels of all time. Very few movie franchises can pick up where film 1 left off and take film 2 into a better place. 

I grew up on this and films like this. I was home sick today so I went back to it for comfort. It's weird to find comfort in 2 hour action packed 90s films, but well, here I am.
