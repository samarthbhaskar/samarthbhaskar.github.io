[LetterboxD review link](https://letterboxd.com/samarthbhaskar/film/spider-man-into-the-spider-verse/)

A rewatch just as rewarding as the first watch. 

A conversation at work subsequent to this rewatch went something like this

- "Wait, there are boarding schools in Brooklyn!?" 
- "there's a kid swinging from buildings and you're asking about the veracity of the education system depicted on screen!?" 

I loled.
