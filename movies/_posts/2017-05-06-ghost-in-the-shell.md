<em>Ghost in the Shell</em>, like the films it inspired (<em>The Matrix</em>, <em>The Fifth Element</em>, <em>Minority Report</em>, among others) suffers from some major short comings. As far as existential sci-fi, the writing is not good enough to carry the weight of the ideas it meant to convey. There were many major plot points that were completely lost because of muddled exposition, incomplete explanation or some other basic flaw of writing.

However, the film is still a groundbreaking work. It's influence, including inspiring a generation of Western films, can be seen in its artistic choices, like the brilliant animated lighting throughout the film. It is a strong entry in the canon of films exploring identity, connectedness, existentialism, violence and power â€” everlasting topics, each of them.
