"How To With Fran Lebowitz," except the motivating emotion is closer to disdain in Fran's case rather than curiosity and sincerity in John Wilson's case. I also found myself thinking about Camille Paglia, who is a Lebowitz type, similarly acerbic and voracious in her critiques, but less accepted in similar circles.
