Another NYFF screening, and like <em>Roma</em>, another point of evidence that some Netflix releases really do need to be viewed in a theater first. 

This compilation of stories, or an anthology film (of which I wish there were more!), has everything you could want from a Coen Brothers movie: nihilism, beautiful editing and cinematography, folksy Americana, a strong belief in narrative, death, comedy, singing and musicality, impressive feats of filmmaking (mile long wagon trail!), and an overall feeling that even if the world ends, at least we'll have had some good times along the way.
