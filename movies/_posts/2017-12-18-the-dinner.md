I'm having a hard time coming up with anything I liked about this movie. Maybe the structural approach, mirroring a dinner, starting with aperitif and ending with dessert? That's really all I can think of.

Somehow this movie conflates mental illness and racism and classism as being causally related. And somehow it manages to be tone deaf and offensive about both things. Speaking of tone. The tonal management of the whole movie is a mess, too. A mid-movie interlude to a Ken Burns style documentary about Gettysburg feels completely out of place. And the constant interjections in conversation and characters talking over each other feels less like "conversations-in-real-life" and more like a director failing to manage his own film. 

It's really too bad that Laura Linney and Rebecca Hall, not to mention Richard Gere and Steve Coogan, got dragged into this project.
