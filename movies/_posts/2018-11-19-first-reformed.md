An incredible piece of writing, directing and acting. A brilliant allegory for our age, in the best ways. Ethan Hawke is a fantastic lead and it's too bad the conversation around his performance got stuck around the awards cycle. He's got much more going on as an artist than any limited conversation about awards could capture.

I've only started to dig into the world of climate change story telling. David Wallace-Wells's book, Elizabeth Kolbert's work and songs like "Wide Awake!" by the Parquet Courts have all piqued by interest. But I do think this is a genre that will build more and more in the coming years as more of our artists' attention is captured by the movement. I expect that will result in all sorts of good, mediocre and bad stories. But I also expect that this will remain one of the original and best stories in the genre.
