From what I could gather in the credits, <em>Good Time</em>, is largely the product of young film-makers. As such, it is an impressive outing for the Safdie Brothers, who made their first film in 2008. The Oneohtrix Point Never original soundtrack was an inspired choice. As a long time fan, I had never considered what his music would sound like in a film, but as soon as I heard it, it made all the sense in the world. 

<em>Good Time</em> reminded me a lot of <em><a href="https://letterboxd.com/samarthbhaskar/film/victoria-2015/">Victoria</a></em>, a film I didn't enjoy very much while watching it (it was exhausting) but have thought about a lot since. Like <em>Victoria</em>, <em>Good Time</em> benefits from an impressive lead performance. Robert Pattinson, who recently had a small but impactful role in <em>The Lost City of Z</em>, like Kristen Stewart, could strongly make a case as one of the best working actors in the industry today. I wonder if Taylor Lautner has any gritty, crime-thrillers, or heady French dramas, in the works to complete the <em>Twilight</em> trifecta transition to indie success stories.
