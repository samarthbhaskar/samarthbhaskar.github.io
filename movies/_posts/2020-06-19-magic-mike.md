[LetterboxD review link](https://letterboxd.com/samarthbhaskar/film/magic-mike/1/)

Little did I know that my debut review on Letterbox would be for a movie I thought wouldn't really stay in my imagination much but, along with its sequel, has become an unexpected favorite from the 2010s. Re-watching it more recently, I was much more into the dance set-pieces. And much less into the story at the center.
