A very wholesome, and almost wholly successful, new-ish thing for John Mulaney to do. He basically can't fail in my eyes. And this did not dissapoint. 

This <a href="https://twitter.com/TheBenKaye/status/1215294117321768961?s=20">twitter thread</a> of 2019 movies as memes from <em>John Mulaney and the Sack Lunch Bunch</em>, in addition to being genius, also captures some of my favorite moments from the whole thing: Jake Gyllenhaal, David Byrne, grandma's boyfriend, movie researcher, really just lots of good stuff.
