A remarkably un-American film where every character is facing a struggle and even if they were to overcome it there doesn't seem to be an cause for celebration. <em>Capernaum</em> felt like a cinematic depiction of a feeling I feel often: overwhelming dread when thinking about the lives of millions, or even billions, of people in the world who live under structural or personal duress. Sitting with that feeling for 2 hours is not for everyone, but I appreciated how this film was able to pull it off.

In fact, it was the final few minutes, when it inevitably turns to swelling music and camera movements to close out the film, the really snapped me out of the trance this film, and its actors had me under.
