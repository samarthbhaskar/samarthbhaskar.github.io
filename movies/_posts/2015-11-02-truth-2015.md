 I'm highly interested in the subject matter of this film - journalism, its importance to democracy, the Bush administration, the elections of 2000 and 2004, and the role new media has played in dismantling traditional media structures. And yet, I spent more time breathing out heavy sighs and rolling my eyes because of how heavy handed this film was in its writing, dialog and direction. 

One guess I have for this, is the possibility that James Vanderbilt, who wrote Zodiac (arguably David Fincher's best film) is a much better writer than a director. In Truth, he wears both hats, and clearly has a hard time understanding what differences exist between writing (where details must be told) and directing (where details must be shown). Some writers are good at telling. Some directors are good at writing. It is very difficult to achieve success in both.
