[LetterboxD review link](http://letterboxd.com/samarthbhaskar/film/by-the-sea-2015/)

 Many of the reviews I've read for this film find nothing redeeming about it. While it is a deeply flawed project, in many ways, I find some of the root ideas interesting. A broken marriage, two broken people, not monsters, but full of faults. Celebrities with commodified bodies, subjects of a voyeuristic society, seduced by voyeurism themselves. Even perfection isn't what it seems. The south of France is played by Malta. There's enough to think about for the length of the film. 

Perhaps this should've been written and made as a short film, instead of a feature length project. Sometimes a short story is a better home for an idea than a novel.
