<em>Lucky</em>, Harry Dean Stanton's final film before he passed away earlier this year reminded me, in some ways, of David Lynch's <em>The Straight Story</em>. Old American men, especially from the Great Generation, live in a rarified space in the imagination of movies. So do laconic men, especially when white, always given the benefit of the doubt that behind their silence is some deep wisdom. In the case of Lucky, he ambles indirectly towards wisdom. Something about happiness. Something about enlightenment. Something about lighting up in a bar like in '68.

<em>Lucky</em> also reminded me of one of my favorite films from last year, Jim Jarmusch's <em><a href="https://letterboxd.com/samarthbhaskar/film/paterson/">Paterson</a></em>. Though <em>Paterson</em> is a far better film overall, not least because of its focus on poetry and art, <em>Lucky</em> has some similar meditative, contemplative tones.
