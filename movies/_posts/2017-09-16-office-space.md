Airplane re-watch.

Few films have had as much staying power and have been described or quoted by my friends as we began our careers as <em>Office Space</em>. From office archetypes, to the anthropology of modern corporate work environments, to the existential malaise that sets in as you become an adult and realize this is your life, maybe forever.

I happen to be working on a project these days, at work, that makes me feel more like the "Bobs" than Peter or any of the other protagonists. This made this rewatch particularly interesting. I don't feel a kinship with the Bobs or the managers, per se, but it was strange to watch from their perspective.
