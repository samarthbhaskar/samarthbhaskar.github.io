[LetterboxD review link](https://letterboxd.com/samarthbhaskar/film/guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol-2/)

The first <em><a href="https://letterboxd.com/samarthbhaskar/film/guardians-of-the-galaxy/">Guardians of the Galaxy</a></em> had the benefit of surprise. In the mix of Marvel movies, it drew the lucky straw of being fun, irreverent, self-referrential, and light-hearted. The sequel, as a result, came in with expectations it had to meet. By and large, <em>Vol 2</em> met these expectations. 

My favorite part of these films is and will probably remain the music at its center. It was an inspired choice to have music play such a large role. And it helps that the music they use is so good.
