As soon as someone mentions this movie, I hear the opening piano riff to Nina Simone's "Sinnerman." Every single time.

More action directors should take their shot at heist movies. It's a nice pairing. And the payoff in this one is worth sticking through some of the sagging emotionality (that doesn't quite work) in the middle third.
