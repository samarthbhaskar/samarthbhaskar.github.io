A great addition to the growing Time Loop genre. We now have a detective/noir story, a comedy, a romantic comedy, a Netflix miniseries, an action movie, horror. And I'm probably forgetting some, too.

That this is one of the better new releases during quarantine, and it's about the same thing happening over and over again is certainly a mood. But these days we don't get the things we want. We get the things we need.
