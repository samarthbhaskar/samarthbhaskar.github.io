I've always known of <em>The Big Chill</em> as the movie with the dinner party/dishwashing scene, where all those white people dance to motown songs. The scene itself, it turns out, is rather short. But the description fits the whole film. Here we see a bunch of white, upper-middle class people, in the early 80s, drowning in their own problems, mostly turning to sex and drugs as the solution, and somehow (almost successfully) co-opting black music as a balm for their own maladies. If a more apt description of Reagonomics exists, I don't know of it.  

For what it's worth - Asghar Farhadi's <a href="https://letterboxd.com/samarthbhaskar/film/about-elly/">About Elly</a> is a much, much better film about friends on a weekend getaway, dealing with problems.
