I grew up on action movies (my dad's favorite genre) but I don't think I quite knew how much <em>Die Hard</em> shaped the genre. It's an incredible film and set the pace for so many others that followed. Rewatches are rewarding. Watching it at different times of life is rewarding. 

I also happened to watch like 3 different Die Hard movies this weekend, and this one is head-and-shoulders above the others. The closest in the series, I think, is <em>Die Hard With a Vengence</em>
