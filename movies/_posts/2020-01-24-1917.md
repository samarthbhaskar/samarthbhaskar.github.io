I wonder if Marty Scorsese would describe this to be more a "theme park ride" than "cinema"? (Not that that dichotomy needs any more air). I guess this is the war movie we deserve in the era of superhero movies. 

It was fine. I saw it. I had a fine time seeing it. But in one of the best film years of the decade, I'm dissapointed it is overtaking other great films in the award conversations.
