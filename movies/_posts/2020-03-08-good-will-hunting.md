Unfortunately, this will almost certainly always remain my comfort movie. Anytime I'm feeling a little down or am on the couch with a stomach ache, watching Matt Damon do equations on a window and ride the T with the sun shining on his face and have a coffee with Minnie Driver and play baseball in an office with Robin Williams, well, it just perks me right up.
