Rian Johnson, maybe even more than being a great film-maker, is a great film watcher. I felt like he was sitting in the seat next to me, enjoying how much I was enjoying this film. 

Also, there was a rant near the end of the film from a major character that sounded a lot like a fan of cinema ranting about saving his house against Netflix. That might be an unfounded guess, but it struck me as something like that in the moment.
