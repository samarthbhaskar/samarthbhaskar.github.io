[LetterboxD review link](http://letterboxd.com/samarthbhaskar/film/nasty-baby/)

 I'm a resident of Brooklyn. I live next to Fort Greene, where this movie takes place. I have many feelings about Brooklyn that are echoed in the first 3/4 of this film. Many features of my life are presented for me to point at, bask in, and smile to myself about in this movie. In fact, I probably would've watched the first 3/4 of the film, come home and have written a nice, pleasant review. There's nothing wrong in basking in a film like "Obvious Child,"  or a show like "Girls" for mirroring back to you all the things you like about your neighborhood and way of life. 

Given how I was feeling before the final act of this film, I should be feeling manipulated or duped by writer director Sebastian Silva. But I don't feel that way. I'm impressed with how easily Silva got me so comfortable with my world he was painting for me, and then how swiftly he pulled the rug from under my feet. The final act of this film is a great rebuke to the self-congratulatory, leisure focused, new bourgeois lifestyles of Brooklynites, myself included. Add some beautiful Fort Greene cinematography, lovable protagonists, soft humor and this makes for a good watch. 

Not giving a shit about what audiences think about your art really frees you up to do some bold things.
