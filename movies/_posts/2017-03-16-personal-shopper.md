A rewatch before this film leaves the theater. I, again, found myself thinking mostly about the partnership between Stewart and Assayas, and how I hope it will continue bearing fruits for us for years to come. Technology, identity, ambition, millennial inability to commit, all these themes are at play in this film. But it succeeds first and foremost because of the story Assayas wants to tell and the confidence Stewart brings in telling it.
