 <em>Spy</em> is a good plane movie. I didn't see it on a plane, but it's got the makings of a good plane movie. 

I was generally on board in the first half, taking a liking to both the character and the plot that was building around her. But when she takes an abrupt turn in the second half I was less sold. I don't mean to imply that McCarthy should only play the nice midwesterner, entirely harmless, just that the caustic, rough edged turn felt like it belonged in a different movie. Her character in <em>Bridesmaids</em>, for comparison, worked much better, both within the ensemble and the tone of the film.
