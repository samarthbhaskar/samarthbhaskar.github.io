Here are some things I liked about <em>The Shape of Water</em>:
- the set design and costumes were beautiful
- the water droplet sequence, on the bus was mesmerizing. I wanted it to go on for much longer.
- the final poem was lovely, and captured the emotionality of the film wonderfully
- I can't believe Guillermo del Toro really pulled off a rom-dram fable with the creature from the black lagoon with more than a few references to sex

But, overall, the film didn't evoke much feeling within me. del Toro also, more than a few times, invoked trite examples to highlight racism, homophobia, or otherness that seemed shoe-horned into the story, rather than natural and grounded in truth.
