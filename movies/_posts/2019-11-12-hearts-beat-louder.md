There's a quick shot in this film of an album cover that Nick Offerman's character recorded as a younger man. It is a close up portrait of his young face. But I'm pretty sure the image comes from <a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EIO6EGmWwAQvdye.jpg">this</a> image of Offerman, in which he is hold a giant, fake penis coming out of his pants. I just think that back story is so funny.

Overall, this was a sweet little movie, with great music, beautiful depictions of Brooklyn and blessed with the presence of Toni Collette. Definitely a multi-tissue watch if you're the owner of a human heart.
