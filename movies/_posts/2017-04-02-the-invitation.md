My first review of this film said there was hardly a reason to go revisit this film. I revisited it, none the less, for a watch among friends after a trip we all took to the Hollywood Hills. I didn't gain much from watching it but it was a fun experience to watch it with friends who were unfamiliar with the movie. Watching them unfold the plot as the movie progressed, and then really lose their minds in the last 20 minutes was fun. And the final shot, of course, was brilliant.

It occurs to me that Gatsby's green light across the bay was somewhat subverted with the red lights across the hills in this film. I doubt that was an explicit goal but it was interesting to consider.
