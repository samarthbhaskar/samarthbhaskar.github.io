Happened to watch this around the time of the George Floyd protests happening around the country. And it resulted in a lot of complex feelings. This docu-series captures so much texture about high school, teaching, local and national political battles, the weight of history, how wise teenagers can be, how frustratingly unaware adults can be, the halting ways in which parents try to do good by their children. There's just so much happening here in 10 episodes. Like <em>Hoop Dreams</em> or <em>The Interruptors</em>, I'll be thinking about this work for a long time. It's less a documentary more a new world view to see the world through.

Steve James, Bing Liu and the Kartemquin crew seem only capable of making masterpieces.
