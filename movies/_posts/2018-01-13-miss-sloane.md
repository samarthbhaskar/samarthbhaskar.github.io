<em>Miss Sloane</em>, a character study more than an astute political drama, suffers from perhaps the same thing that our current political conversations suffer from. It's hard to make a full diagnosis, but it's some combination of a belief that politics, or more specifically the process of policy making, is a battle of preferences, bargaining and dirty work. Rather than something done in service of the public, through deliberation, and the use of evidence. If our policy making process becomes this, we get the politics we deserve -- salacious, dramatized, and also swept up in the cult of personality. 

This sort of dramatization of our political process, and I include my profession of journalism in this indictment, is bad for our society.

As a movie, <em>Miss Sloane</em> is also not very good.
