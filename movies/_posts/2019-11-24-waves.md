<em>Waves</em> is a heavy, difficult, film. In some ways, it is literally difficult on the eyes, with strobing lights and deep visual Trey Edward Shults's apprenticeship under Terrance Mallick has been present in his filmmaking from the beginning. A lot of the imagery here benefits from some of the same grandeur, even interior shots. And the mirror images here, replicating the dualism of the story, work well.

Overall, the film is not as successful as his previous work, but it is a commendable feature. Among some of the best films of this year.

Also the soundtrack is basically my top played tracks on Spotify: Frank Ocean, Tame Impala, Animal Collective, Amy Winehouse, Tyler the Creator, Kendrick Lamar, etc.
