I loved <em>The Cable Guy</em> when I saw it first in the early 2000s. It was, for the TV generation, what <em>Ingrid Goes West</em> aims to be for the social media generation. Aubrey Plaza puts in a solid performance, helped along the way by supporting roles from Elizabeth Olsen and O'Shea Jackson Jr. The criticisms of identity, happiness and persona in this film are interesting if only grazing the surface. What <em>Men, Women and Children</em> tried to do a few years ago, but largely failed, <em>Ingrid</em> does slightly better, and if nothing else, has more fun doing it.
