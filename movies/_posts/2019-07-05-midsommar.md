I had a weird experience watching <em>Midsommar</em> this summer that I haven't been able to fully understand. There was something...odd...about watching white tribal behavior on screen elicit laughter in the audience. I had a hard time imagining similar brown tribal behavior eliciting the same response. I guess, what I'm describing is, uh, racism. And an anodyne instance of that. But, still, it was strange.
