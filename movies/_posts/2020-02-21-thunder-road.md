[LetterboxD review link](https://letterboxd.com/samarthbhaskar/film/thunder-road-2018/)

I completely missed that this was a movie a couple of years ago, came across it on a Letterboxd list of "2010s Most Overlooked Films," noticed it was streaming on Amazon Prime (which, along the Hulu, has some of the best streaming choices these days), and caught up with it on a quiet Saturday afternoon.

Many of the reviews have referred to this character as too closely related to something Danny McBride would do, but I've always found McBride's characters to be lacking in sincerity while this character oozed it. The complaints about the ending are well worth considering but there are a lot of redeemable qualities, too: the hands up game, some of the final scenes between the protagonist, his daughter and his best friend, the funeral scene. Tonally, Cummings did a remarkable job finding a novel voice and tone for this story and carrying it through the whole film. 

There are some politics within this movie too: about loss, personal responsibility, expectations and community. But they're concealed beneath a tightly wound, funny, and dark top layer. I hope Cummings creates more work like this in the future. And that he continues to explore some of those same ideas through his characters.
