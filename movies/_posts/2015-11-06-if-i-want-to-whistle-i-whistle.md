 I had only seen 4 months, 3 weeks, 2 days prior to this Romanian New Wave addition. Both films are great additions to international cinema, with energetic acting, directing and script writing, poised to make a big mark on the world stage for years to come. 

I wonder if this is how some people felt while seeing French New Wave come of age.
