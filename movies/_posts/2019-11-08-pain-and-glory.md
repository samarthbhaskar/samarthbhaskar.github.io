As auto-fiction takes over literature, TV and film, it was great to see one of the greatest, ever, to do it (use his own life experience to tell stories), do it in this remarkable way. We tell ourselves stories about ourselves to save our lives.

The much-discussed scene reuniting to ex-lovers, in which Banderas knocks you out with the dart of an eye, and the final shot are both deserving of all the praise.
