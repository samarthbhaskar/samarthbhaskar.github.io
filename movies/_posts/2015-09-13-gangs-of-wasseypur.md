 Part 1 down, part 2 to follow. I hope I get an answer to my main question, which is simply - "why a Muslim family?" There are plenty of stories to be told about Hindu mafias and violence. Something peculiar about picking out a Muslim story to tell. But I'll hold off on making any claims until I've seen part 2.
