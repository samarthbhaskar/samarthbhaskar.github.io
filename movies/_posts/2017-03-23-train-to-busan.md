A fine action-thriller. Took something from <em>Snowpiercer</em>, <em>28 Days Later</em>, and other modern, linear, zombie action films. Honestly, I was most impressed with Soo-an Kim's performance as the young daughter. She had Jacob Tremblay level acting chops, often acting her adult co-stars under the table.
