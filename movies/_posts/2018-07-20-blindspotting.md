<em>Blindspotting</em> like <em>Sorry To Bother You</em>, which came out a week before it, are brilliant West Coast social satires. <em>Blindspotting</em> has a great duo at its center that helps highlight some of the race and gender dynamics at play in the story. But I will say that I found Diggs's acting to have a plastic quality about it, keeping me from fully immersing myself in the film. That is, until the final scene, which he delivers superbly and might go down as one of the most powerful music moments in cinema this year.

Overall, I thought the film was vibrant, funny, acerbic and tonally punchy (in a good way). But it did feel like a story told by young writers and filmmakers who have a lot to say but don't quite know exactly what they want to say.
