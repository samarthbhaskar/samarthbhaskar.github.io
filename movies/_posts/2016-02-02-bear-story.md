 A devastating short. The whole thing was captured for me in a moment when the bear is ringing a bell above his head to attract passersby on the street to stop, pay him a coin, and watch his story. He has his eyes closed, but a far away look on his face. When we see his face next, he is just as sad, but a little more present. He is made slightly more content knowing that his story touched the small boy who just watched it, and that, helps ease his pain.
