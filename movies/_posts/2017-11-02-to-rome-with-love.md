[LetterboxD review link](https://letterboxd.com/samarthbhaskar/film/to-rome-with-love/)

Netflix sent me a push notification recently that Woody Allen's <em>To Rome With Love</em> was available for streaming and that they thought I might be interested. They were right. I was interested. Then I watched it. And I guess we were both wrong. 

Allen balances the surreal and the real, the sappy and the funny pretty well in this film. But he does that much better in other films, like <em>Midnight in Paris</em> or <em>Blue Jasmine</em>. This film buckles under the weight of the ensemble cast approach. The distracting star power of its cast. And the under-realized themes about love, intimacy and commitment that it intends to explore. 

I'll probably still watch every thing Woody Allen creates. In the hope of finding a new <em>Annie Hall</em>, <em>Manhattan</em>, <em>Crimes and Misdemeanors</em> or <em>Midnight in Paris</em> again someday.
