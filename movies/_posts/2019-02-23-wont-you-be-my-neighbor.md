Morgan Neville is racking up one win after another. <em>20 Feet From Stardom</em> is one of the most memorable documentaries of the 2000s. I enjoyed <em>Best of Enemies</em>, too. And this film is a deeply spiritual, moralistic, film. The kind that you don't get much of any more these days. But I suppose you don't get many Mr. Rogers in a lifetime either. Although the film could have used some formal variety to break up some of the plotting and story-telling monotony, it wins on charisma points alone. 

Much like Mr. Rogers and his television work -- we don't show up for formal innovation. We show up for the message and how this work makes us feel about ourselves.
