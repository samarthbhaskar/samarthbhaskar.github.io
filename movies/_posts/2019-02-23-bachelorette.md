I watched RUSSIAN DOLL (like every self-respecting Netflix subscriber in America) and I wanted to check out more of Lesley Headland's work. Turns out you need Natasha Lyonne to really add the edge that this movie thinks it was going for. Otherwise you just get the angst. I also suppose that in 2012, when this movie came out, unlikeable female leads were hard to find across tv and film. By 2019, unlikeability, on its own, isn't enough.
