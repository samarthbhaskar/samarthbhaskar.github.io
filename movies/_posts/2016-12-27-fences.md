It seems the answer to "I wonder how Denzel Washington will adapt this incredible August Wilson play for the screen" is -- exactly like a play. There are less than a handful of shots where the camera moves, where we get cuts and close-ups, or any sort of visual variety. However, what this movie lacks in visual poetry, it makes up for in acting and pathos. 

The denouement feels somewhat stretched and overly pregnant with a need for closure. But the overwhelming feeling I was left with was a heavy sorrow, for a man and a family who can't quite expand beyond the space in which they've been placed.
