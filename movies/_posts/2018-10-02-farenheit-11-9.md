Michael Moore has a hammer. And everything he sees is a nail.

(After walking out of this movie, I remember thinking, wow, was I a fool to think so highly of films like <em>Roger & Me</em>, <em>Bowling for Columbine</em>, <em>Fahrenheit 9/11</em> and others? But then I realized, I've changed, Michael Moore hasn't.)
