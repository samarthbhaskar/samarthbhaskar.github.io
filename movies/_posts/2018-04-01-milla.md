[LetterboxD review link](https://letterboxd.com/samarthbhaskar/film/milla/)

I saw <em>Milla</em> at a film festival immediately after seeing <em><a href="https://letterboxd.com/samarthbhaskar/film/ava-2017/">Ava</a></em>. Two films about young women making their way through the world, and they couldn't have been more different.

In <em>Ava</em> we see a young girl struggling to find freedom while living in a conservative society. <em>Milla</em>, on the other hand, is based in France, arguably one of the leading bastions of western society marked by autonomy and freedom for its citizens. But here's a young woman struggling in myriad ways. The juxtaposition really laid bare the false promise of fredom in the West. 

The Q&A with the film maker afterward also shed great light onto her choices in writing and directing this film and the intimate relationship she created with the main actress. The depth of their relationship is present on screen and a gift they generously share with us, the viewers.
