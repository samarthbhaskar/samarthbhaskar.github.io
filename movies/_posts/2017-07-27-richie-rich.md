<em>Richie Rich</em> was one of my favorite childhood movies. I saw it, for the first time, shortly after immigrating to the US from India. I didn't know it at the time but Richie's house and family represented, to me, the America I wanted to play in. And in my mind, I was one of the kids from the city coming in for a play date. I'm sure most other kids saw it through the eyes of those kids, too, but there was something especially meaningful. I, in some way, actually got to move into Richie's house when I became an American. Or so I thought.

1994 had multiple spoiled brat hits, among them, <em>Billy Madison</em>, <em>Baby's Day Out</em>, <em>Blank Check</em>, which - if one were inclined to say - could have something to do with post Reagonomics era inequality anxiety making its way on to the screen.
