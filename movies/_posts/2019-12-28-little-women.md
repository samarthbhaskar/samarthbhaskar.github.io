I walked in almost entirely unfamiliar with the source material. I never read the book, had never seen any of the other adaptations. After feeling somewhat unmoored for the first 30 minutes, I walked out of the movie in tears, fully in love with every character, and committed to the idea that Greta Gerwig is one of the most talented artists of our generation. One of my favorite movie-going experiences of this decade. I'm so excited to be around for the remainder of Greta Gerwig's film-making career.
