Over the holidays, I end up watching or rewatching a lot of movies with my parents. They were so taken by <em>Sicario</em> that they wanted to watch more films like it. So I suggested <em>Wind River</em>. They're now, officially, Taylor Sheridan converts. The man-splainy stuff between Elizabeth Olsen and Jeremy Renner was a little cringeworthy, but this is a solid movie overall.
