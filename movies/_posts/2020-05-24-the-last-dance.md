8-hours of revisionist, spon-con, Michael Jordan PR pitches. And I'm here for all of it. Watching this on Sundays, with friends from Chicago over Zoom was one of the few highlights of quarantine.

You should probably just read this <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/29180890/michael-jordan-history-flight">ESPN feature</a> instead, honestly, if you want an actual story about what makes Michael Jordan tick.
