 Much like the candidate himself, "Sweet Micky for President" shines because of its bombastic, vibrant, entertaining nature. But also like the candidate, it fails to deliver on substance. This is much less a documentary about politics, the effect of the 2010 earthquake or the role of Haiti in the world, and much more a reality-TV style look behind the scenes. 

Pras Michel was in attendance at the screening I went to on a quiet Tuesday night. His role in this whole thing, including why he was watching it with 10 others in NYC on a Tuesday, remain open questions for me.
