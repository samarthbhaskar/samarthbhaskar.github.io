During a pivotal, possibly the most engaging stretch (in an overall very engaging movie) an American worker in the Fuyao factory walks around holding up a Union sign. He's swiftly escorted off the factory floor by security. Before driving off the premises in his truck, he turns to the camera, smiles, and says, "sometimes you gotta be your own Sally Field." The filmmakers put in years into making this film, capturing facial expressions, large meetings, conferences in China, and quiet, contemplative moments. But they also got massively lucky with scenes like this where a man explicitly refrenced <em>Norma Rae</em>. You really couldn't have written it better.

This film is one of the best modern works about work, economics and politics I've seen. I learned more about globalization in 2 hours than I have in the last 15 years of reading books or taking classes on the topic. What Thomas Friedman pithily called a "Flat World" gets depicted as a topsy-turvy, deeply human, world. 

The most intersting parts of the film, for me, were the collective bargaining scenes. The C-suite, the anti-union consultants, the older American workers who had seen the benefits of collective bargaining, the younger American workers who were unconvinced, the Chinese workers who were, similarly, unconvinced that they needed anyone but the managers to look out for them; it all created some of the most palpable tension and action in a documentary about making auto-glass.

My own family has a story similar to this, but more in the middle-class end of the working spectrum. An American insurance company, in the late 90s, decided that it needed to beef up its technology operation. It hired a few thousand Indian technologists. We arrived in a small town in Illinois. The engineers got to the work of building databases and tech infrastructure. And the families got to the work of building homes, going to school, and making lives. So many of the scenes of shared meals, awkward cultural interactions, well-meaning but sometimes condescending conversations, and the always-present hum of American cultural supremacy were very familiar to me. The filmmakers did a remarkable job capturing a slice of this strange phase of life we're in as humans on this planet.
