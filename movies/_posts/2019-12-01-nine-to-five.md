WNYC has a new short-run podcast about <a href="https://www.npr.org/podcasts/765024913/dolly-parton-s-america">Dolly Parton</a> which reminded me to check out <em>Nine to Five</em>. It's a romp of a film, a relatively fun watch. But the thing I couldn't get over was how unabashed it is in its collective politics. It's hard to imagine a film like this being made in 2019.
