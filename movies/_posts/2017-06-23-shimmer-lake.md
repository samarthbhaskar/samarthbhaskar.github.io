Netflix allows you to download films onto your device, which is helpful for long airplane rides. Which is to say, I downloaded this before a long airplane ride and watched it despite not really finding it very interesting.

The narrative conceit, of telling a story backwards, works in its favor, but it's not enough to elevate it beyond the constraints of an overall poorly written and directed story.
