<em>Everybody Knows</em> was a good movie. A good one to watch on Netflix, especially. It's a rewarding, curled on the couch, on a rainy afternoon kind of movie. And I like that Farhadi ventured out to direct in Spanish. I'm looking forward to more ambitious work from him in coming years.

But, and let me say this emphatically, <em><a href="https://letterboxd.com/samarthbhaskar/film/about-elly/">About Elly</a></em> is a much, much, much better Farhadi film about kidnapping and disappearance. It's almost unbelievable how much better that film is then <em>Everybody</em>. Please, I implore you, watch <em>About Elly</em>.
