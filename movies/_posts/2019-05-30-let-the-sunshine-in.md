[LetterboxD review link](https://letterboxd.com/samarthbhaskar/film/let-the-sunshine-in/)

Like Netflix's "Dating Around," but directed by Claire Denis and starring the always mesmerizing Juliette Binoche. (I'm being flippant, but there really is something eternal about trying to find romantic partners.)
