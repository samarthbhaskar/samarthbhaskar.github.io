I've been re-watching a lot of romantic comedies during quarantine, it's the only thing that helps make me feel better. So it only made sense to make time for this film. Arguably one of the best romantic films of all time. You can't help but fall in love with every character, every part of Hong Kong, and every part of being a frail, unprotected, human while watching this movie.
