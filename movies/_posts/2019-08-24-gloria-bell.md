Gloria Bell's phone has a familiar ring tone in this movie. I'm sure we've all heard it as someone's alarm or phone ringtone in the last few years. It comes up in this movie a couple of times. At first, it is pleasant, hopeful even. By the end, it is a menace. The ringtone follows some of the emotional arcs of this film. 

Sonia Braga in <em><a href="https://letterboxd.com/samarthbhaskar/film/aquarius/">Aquarius</a></em> and Isabelle Huppert in <em><a href="https://letterboxd.com/samarthbhaskar/film/things-to-come-2016/">Things to Come</a></em> and <em><a href="https://letterboxd.com/samarthbhaskar/film/elle/">Elle</a></em> were some of the closest points of comparison that I was thinking about during this film. Those characters, to me, were much more resolute and complex, as compared to Julianne Moore's character in this film. I don't think I'll revisit this film. But I'll almost certainly revisit Braga and Huppert's films.
