 The biggest irony for this film is that it is trying to critique mass entertainment, doctored suspense and fake alarmism using the tools of the trade. Unfortunately, instead of trying a satirical approach, it tries a self-serious approach. And ultimately that just doesn't work, despite Jodie Foster's best attempts.

The saddest thing about that is that we absolutely need art to put a mirror up against society in a time like this. Especially about this topic. But I fear this will be a forgotten thriller, aspiring to be like <em>Network</em> but landing more like <em>Inside Man</em> + <em>An Inconvenient Truth</em>.
