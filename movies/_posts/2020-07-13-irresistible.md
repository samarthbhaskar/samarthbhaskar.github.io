As a once-and-again-sort-of-now political professional, who lives in NYC, and grew up in the Midwest, I feel it is not possible for me to ethically review this film. Or, perhaps, I am one of very few people who should review this film. 

As a once-upon-a-time journalist, I can say with confidence, that on the list of people who should make a film like this, it should not be Jon Stewart.
