Like its protagonist, Lazzaro, <em>Happy as Lazzaro</em> is difficult to describe. It's comedic and melancholy; modern and plucked from the past; depicts real places and feels like a fairytale; has biblical roots and strong anti-capitalist politics. There's a lot happening in this deceptively simple story. But the strongest feeling I walked away with was a sense of empathy for Lazzaro and his community.
