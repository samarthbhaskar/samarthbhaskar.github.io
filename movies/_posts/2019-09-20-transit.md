Like <em>Phoenix</em>, <em>Transit</em> is another of Petzold's brilliant explorations of identity and self construction. In an era whiplashing between an unsatisfying literalism or an unsatisfying sense of erasure about identity, Petzold is doing great work to get us to understand how we create ourselves for the world and how the world creates us. 

I'm looking forward to more of these explorations. I hope the next is set in present day.
