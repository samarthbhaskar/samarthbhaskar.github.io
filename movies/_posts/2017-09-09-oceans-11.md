An airplane re-watch, for the first time in a long time.

Sometimes when I re-watch films I loved as a youth, with the time and distance, and I love them again, it's hard to know how to disaggregate those feelings. Do I love them because I used to love them as a kid? Do I love them because they're good? I don't know if I'll ever know, really. But I do love this film.
