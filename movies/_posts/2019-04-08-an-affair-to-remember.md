A classic movie I had never seen. It certainly has all the makings of what would later become the modern rom-com genre, and its genes, you can see, are present in later work by Nora Ephron and others. But, boy, I'm glad films learned their lesson and no longer have long, unnecessary, scenes with children singing songs.
