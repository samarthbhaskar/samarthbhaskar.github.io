The thing <em>Mangrove</em> was missing, McQueen's best quality, is present here in spades. Life these days feel very literal, immediate and circumscribed. This film provided the best escapasism I could ask for. Sweaty dancing among friends. Touching someone's elbow. Riding a bike down the street with new love.
