Airplane re-watch.

<em>Léon</em>, is clearly Luc Besson's best film. And I say this as a big fan of <em>The Fifth Element</em>. One thing that struck me on this re-watch, was how good Besson is at directing side characters. What inner life and nuance may be lacking from Léon or Tony, is basically the same approach that serves to make the old lady in the hallway or the old man at the front desk of the hotel so fascinating. There's something about Besson's ability to make a character who is on screen for mere seconds feel memorable and distinct that falls short for his main characters. None the less, this doesn't stop Natalie Portman from making Mathilda one of the most memorable characters from this era of films.
