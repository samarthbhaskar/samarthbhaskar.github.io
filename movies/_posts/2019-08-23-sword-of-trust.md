Marc Maron has cornered the market for playing Marc Maron on screen. And I'm not mad about it. It's certainly better than him playing Marc Maron in the first 30 minutes of his podcast episodes.

This was a fun, simple film. The likes of which we hardly see get theatrical releases anymore. But the kind of film I'd love to see more during quiet summer months.
