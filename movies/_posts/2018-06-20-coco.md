The central conceit of this film, that the dead only die when no one who remembers them is left alive, is an emotional gut punch. But the Pixar filmmakers do a commendable job writing beautiful music, creating lovable characters and telling a fun (albeit conventional Pixar type story) to take this conceit into an interesting place. 

The music will make this movie rewatchable for years to come, but I don't think it rises to the top of Pixar's best films list among <em>Finding Nemo</em>, <em>Ratatouille</em> and <em>Toy Story</em>.
