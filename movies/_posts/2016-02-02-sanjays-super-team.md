 My favorite part of this short was the depiction of a late 80s/early 90s immigrant Indian apartment. Barely any furniture, white walls, white blinds, but definitely a TV and definitely a DIY religious shrine. Every picture from my childhood would reflect that setting. I was expecting to fully love "Sanjay's Super Team," (one of my friends was on the creative team, I'm the Sanjay in my own life, etc) and I did. It is a great addition to Pixar's library of short films.
