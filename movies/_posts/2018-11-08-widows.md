<em>Widows</em> is one of the best Chicago films I've ever seen. It's one of the best heist movies I've ever seen. It's one of the best female ensemble movies I've ever seen. It has career-topping performances from multiple lead actors. It has been a topic of conversation with my friends for months since we saw it and I still think it's underrated.
