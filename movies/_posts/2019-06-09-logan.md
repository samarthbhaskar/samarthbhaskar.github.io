[LetterboxD review link](https://letterboxd.com/samarthbhaskar/film/logan-2017/1/)

A TV rewatch while working on the couch one day. 

<em>Logan</em> has some inspired references to noir, Westerns and action films with children. It is also one of the first superhero or major studio films to wrestle with the complications around aging and reckoning with morality in a time when anti-heroes are to be found everywhere but it does fall back on old Hollywood concepts of heroism and saviorism instead of showing characters facing complicated choices and using a new compass (something more than saviorism or masculinity) to make the right choice.
