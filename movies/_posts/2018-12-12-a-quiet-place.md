This happens every year: a couple of movies from earlier in the year (January or February) when the release schedule is quieter, break through the morass and become part of the end-of-the-year best-of-the-year conversations. <em>A Quiet Place</em> sort of made it onto this list this year. People were talking about it at the time it came out but it has had longer staying power than I expected. 

John Krasinski has described this movie as a love letter to his children, and you can feel that come across the screen at times, but the more impressive and memorable part of the film, for me, was seeing a new director try his hand at a story he wanted to tell, and more or less, succeed at it. In some respects this is a debut film and an impressive first directorial outing, but Krasinski is not just any old debut director. He clearly had a lot of support from industry experts (in an interview with the NYTimes, he mentioned, in particular the design studio that created his monster also worked with George Lucas on Star Wars and Steven Spielberg on Jurassic Park). In the parlance of our times, Krasinski, as a director, was born on 3rd base and hit a home run. 

All that aside, the movie itself was entertaining throughout, especially the first 20 or 30 minutes when we get to know the family, understand the world, and get a feel for what living in complete silence might involve.

Separately, I also enjoyed considering the critical race theory articulated by Wesley Morris and Jenna Wortham on <a href="https://player.fm/series/still-processing-1785512/we-watch-whiteness">"Still Processing"</a> earlier in the year.
