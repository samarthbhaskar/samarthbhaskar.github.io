 Chris Rock counts Woody Allen among his many inspirations. The work of Woody Allen, the walk-and-talks, scenes around New York, flirtation through conversation, romanticism in argumentation, all of these are present in <em>Top Five</em>. Rock is never ripping off, he is always paying homage, but making these scenes his own - which is no small accomplishment. 

What he takes from Allen (also a namesake for Rock's character in the film), and updates, is his relationship with Rosario Dawson and women in general on screen. Woody Allen seems to respect some women more than others throughout his filmography. Rock, on the other hand (his depictions of strippers notwithstanding) seems much better at treating women as his intellectual and artistic peers. He trusts Rosario Dawson most, but even smaller characters like Leslie Jones, Gabrielle Union, and Sherri Shepherd are treated better than the average woman in a Woody Allen film.
