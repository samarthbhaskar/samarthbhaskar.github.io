 This film probably wouldn't have crossed my radar if not for Filmspotting, but I don't think I loved it as much as Josh, Adam and others. I got into the lead actor. I can look past the loose ends in writing and editing. I could even give it a pass for the lack of plotting, ambition or structure. But to be any more forgiving would be to fall prey to exactly the kind of unearned forgiveness the protagonist receives throughout the whole film.

If I had to pick a tagline, it would probably be something like "being a white guy, amirite?"
