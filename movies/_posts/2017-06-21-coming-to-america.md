I've seen this film, probably, 50 times in my life. I can quote huge chunks from memory. I know exactly when certain scenes and jokes will land and I laugh in anticipation and again upon delivery. I love this film, so, so much. I have multiple friendships that started based on a mutual love of this film.

There's a guy in my gym who sometimes wheres a "Zamunda" tee shirt. I really want to buy that tee shirt.
