I know this point has been made before but 2019 Taxi Driver would feature Travis Bickle watching a lot of YouTube, arguing with people on Twitter and reading Jordan Peterson's "12 Rules for Life". 

I also think an under theorized aspect of this film, and in academic literature around the topic, is the true cost of war: namely the mental health burden on society from soldiers returning with PTSD, depression and other issues. This film has a strong, memorable depiction of the effects of war on a person.
