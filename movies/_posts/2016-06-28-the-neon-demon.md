 The opening credits for <em>The Neon Demon</em> feature Nicolas Winding Refn's initials in every frame. Why? I couldn't tell you. But I think it has something to do with narcissism. 

There are some laudable things in this movie. The score. The style. The color theory. Some of the acting, mostly Elle Fanning. 

But, overall, there just isn't enough substance and insight to make this more than an aesthetic experience. If Winding Refn set out to do some moralizing about beauty, narcissism, and fashion, I fear he may be the wrong person for the task.
