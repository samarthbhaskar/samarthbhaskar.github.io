A great drive-in movie to go see while visiting family. 

Although, the part where we locked ourselves out of the car as soon as we got to the drive-in, had to call the cops to come unlock us, and the Lady Cop who showed up and used all sorts of nifty things to unlock the car but didn't say something like, "It's a Unix System, I know this!" left me a little bummed out.
