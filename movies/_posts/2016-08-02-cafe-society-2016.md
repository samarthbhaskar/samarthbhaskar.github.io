 Vittorio Storaro's photography in <em>Café Society</em> is possibly the best cinematography in a Woody Allen film since Gordon Willis' in <em>Manhattan</em>. That might sound hyperbolic but you've got to see the photography in this film. It is worth the price of admission. 

Other benefits of seeing this film include: Kristen Stewart, who seems to have taken her experience in <em>Clouds of Sils Maria</em> and is totally running with it. And I for one am happy to see her turn in one fantastic performance after another. Some interesting philosophical stuff about Judaism, Christianity, end-of-life thoughts. And, well, that's about all.

Overall, the film is ok. It is not among Allen's best. But it is not his worst.
