My mom and I needed something to do to kill a couple of hours in New Orleans on Mothers' Day weekend. This seemed like a fine way to kill time. It was not. We went to a nice theater with recliners and drinks. I had some wine and took a nap. My mom ate some popcorn. And then she woke me up and asked if we could leave. I was happy to oblige.
