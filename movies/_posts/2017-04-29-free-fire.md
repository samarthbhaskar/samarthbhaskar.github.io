Not really much to review here. The action was somewhat hard to follow, mostly because of the difficult spatial lay out of the set. Somehow, despite being a chamber piece, where we never leave one location, I felt lost the whole time. The tone was well managed. Basically set by Sharlto Copley and followed by everyone else pretty well. As far as the action itself, it was fine. And some of the subversions about the black guy always being the first to die and Brie Larson's "ugh, men" line were good.

Made me want to re-watch <em>The Wind That Shakes The Barley</em>, though, just to get more of that sweet sweet Cillian Murphy Irish brogue.
