The book of the summer, at least media-twitter summer, was Taffy Brodesser-Akner's <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2945638347">"Fleishman Is in Trouble"</a>. A <a href="https://twitter.com/samarth/status/1147949498703994880">passage</a> in it, describes a wife not as a "ultra-girlfriend or a permanent girlfriend [but] . . . an entirely new thing. She's something you made together, with you as an ingredient. She couldn't be the wife without you. So hating her is . . . is like hating your own finger. . . You don't separate from it. You look at your wife and you're not looking at someone you hate. You're looking at someone and seeing your own disabilities and your own disfigurement. You're hating your creation. You're hating yourself." 

Baumbach's <em>Marriage Story</em> is a feature film length exploration of this idea. It puts two fantastic actors at work exploring this idea. It thrusts this idea into the therapists office. Into the lawyer's office. Into your in-law's house. Into your new apartment that needs to be furnished. Into the toughest year of your life. And, as a viewer, you sit there, watching this exploration with a two ton stone on your chest. By the end, Baumbach doesn't lift the stone for you, unfortunately. You walk out thanking him for gifting you a nice new two ton stone.
