 I don't know too much about Nick Kroll but I've seen some of his work in the Kroll Show and The League. I'm also largely unfamiliar with the Duplass brothers, but I know their work a bit better. Of their work I've seen so far, this ranks near the bottom for me. It felt like the whole cast had been infected by Kroll's too-cool-to-care attitude. It also didn't help that the cast wasn't given much of a script to build from. Sometimes scripts give the sense that just a few more rounds of edits and they could've been shaped into something better. This script was not even close to that. This script needed a few new ideas, maybe a few new characters, and a whole different plot to make it any better.
