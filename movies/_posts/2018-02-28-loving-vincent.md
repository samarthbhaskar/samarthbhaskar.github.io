<em>Loving Vincent</em>, story wise, is a 15 minute story, stretched to a 2 hour film, with one red-herring after another. That creates a frustrating experience as a viewer. But the hand-painted frames were amazing to see on screen. The motion created through the painting style. As a viewer watching this film in 2018, knowing where modern art has gone since van Gogh's contributions, knowing his impact on art history brings a weight to this film that only enhances the experience of taking in hundreds of frames of beautiful art work.
