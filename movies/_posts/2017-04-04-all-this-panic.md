[LetterboxD review link](https://letterboxd.com/samarthbhaskar/film/all-this-panic/)

A seemingly simple idea: follow teenage girls around NYC for 3 years. With strong editing and story telling, an idea as simple as this is elevated to a beautiful story about friendship, young-adulthood, transitions and family. Some of the film-making choices, like sticking with blurry shots and canted angles, were inexplicable to me. I tried to find a reason for these choices but never found a clear answer.

But this film isn't about framing, lighting, sound or any of these things. It's about a handful of teenage girls, awkwardly, lovingly, courageously dealing with becoming themselves.
