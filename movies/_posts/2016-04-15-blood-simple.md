 Of the many themes that show up over and again in the Coen Brothers' filmography, one of my favorites is the idea that there's no hell or after-life. Hell is here, on earth. You pay for your sins before you die. 

<em>Blood Simple</em> may be the best summation of this theme. The tone is set from the beginning but there's a particular shot when Marty, responding to Meurice, says "I'm going to stay right here in hell, tonight." We go many places throughout the rest of the film, but we never really leave hell.
