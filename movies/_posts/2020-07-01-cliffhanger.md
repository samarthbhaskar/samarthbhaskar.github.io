I watched this movie a lot as a kid. It was one of my Dad's favorites and among the whole 80s, 90s action genre which he introduced to me, this was one of the best. It had been a long time since my last rewatch and it's remarkable how much of it I remembered scene by scene, word by word. You can't say that about a lot of action movies.
