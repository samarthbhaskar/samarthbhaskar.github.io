A <em><a href="https://letterboxd.com/samarthbhaskar/film/good-time/">rewatch</a></em> that doesn't really reward multiple viewings. <em>Good Time</em> is a pretty straightforward story that once you see unfold once you've basically gotten everything out of it. I'm still looking forward to <em>Uncut Gems</em>, though.
