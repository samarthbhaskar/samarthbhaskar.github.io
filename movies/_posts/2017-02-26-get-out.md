Jordan Peele, for the majority of his time in the public eye, has exercised his artistic vision through sketches, characters, improv and impressions. To wit, this is the first major work of his in which his artistic vision, his politics, his personality, are fully his own. And he doesn't even show up on screen. But in choices like the Childish Gambino song Redbone (with "Stay Woke" in its chorus), twists and turns in his writing, Peele has created a movie for the Black Lives Matter generation. It will stand next to <a href="https://letterboxd.com/samarthbhaskar/film/straight-outta-compton/">Straight Outta Compton</a> and perhaps even <a href="https://letterboxd.com/samarthbhaskar/film/moonlight-2016/">Moonlight</a> as complex film for audiences who are rarely served a complex cultural diet.

The social satire, depiction of race and racism are all fascinating. But the film is, first and foremost, an entertaining theater going experience. Seeing it with a packed crowd, much like <a href="https://letterboxd.com/samarthbhaskar/film/toni-erdmann/">Toni Erdmann</a>, was a rewarding experience. This is a film made for yelling at the screen, laughing and gasping with tons of other viewers. 

Lakeith Stanfield (not to ignore Catherine Keener and Daniel Kaluuya) had probably only 10 minutes on screen but he was great. His work in <em>Atlanta</em> earlier this year was fantastic. To see him in this role was another great piece of evidence toward his undeniable talent. 

Although the film wasn't the scariest social thriller I've seen recently (<a href="https://letterboxd.com/samarthbhaskar/film/the-witch-2015/">The Witch</a> or <a href="https://letterboxd.com/samarthbhaskar/film/it-follows/">It Follows</a> probaly take the cake), I loved seeing a film about racism that didn't stand on sanctimony. <em>Dear White People</em>'s satire didn't quite work for me. But this film totally worked.
