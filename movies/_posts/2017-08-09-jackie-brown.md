A scene in the first act of <em>Jackie Brown</em>, my favorite of Quentin Tarantino's films, shows the protagonist explaining to Max Cherry, the best named bail bondsman ever depicted in a story, what she's scared of. She's scared of getting old. She's scared of having no options. Of going into her twilight years alone and with no resources. That, to her, is "scarier than Ordell." As a result, she takes her fate into her own hands. I wish every one facing their twilight years had the temerity that Jackie Brown displays. 

Tarantino is a great story teller. <em>Jackie Brown</em> and the <em>Kill Bill</em> films are some of the best examples of how well he can develop characters, how details play a big part in his story telling, and how he can use the tools of narrative, emotions, action and plot to take us, his audience, on a journey.
