[LetterboxD review link](https://letterboxd.com/samarthbhaskar/film/a-star-is-born-2018/)

The first half of this film and every musical performance are among some of the best cinema I saw in 2018. Then the 2nd half confirmed my fear before going into this film: that the "star" in in <em>A Star is Born</em>, according to Bradley Cooper, is Bradley Cooper.

I guess that's what you get when you have Clint Eastwood as your mentor. 

I will say, though, that this film should win some points for me a total, unabashed, unmatched meme-machine in 2018. It's not easy to dominate cultural conversation for weeks before and after release. I don't think those are points for it being good cinema, but points for...something.
