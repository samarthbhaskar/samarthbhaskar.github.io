Craig Mazin! I'm fascinated by a man who goes from making <em>The Hangover</em>, <em>Identity Thief</em> and <em>Scary Movie 3</em> and dunking on Ted Cruz on twitter in 2016 to a masterpiece of historical TV drama. One of the best TV shows of the last 10 years. 

I have talked about few shows as much as I've talked about <em>Chernobyl</em> with friends throughout 2019.
