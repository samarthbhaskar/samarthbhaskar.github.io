The torture scenes are very difficult to watch. Especially if, like me, you spent a lot of time in the early 2000s reading and learning about the persecution of Muslims in the West, historically and at present. 

Overall, <em>The Report</em> is a less than great successor to <em>Zero Dark Thirty</em>, which, in retrospect is an amazingly cinematic political thriller. Also, comparisons to <em>Spotlight</em> and other journalistic thrillers is interesting because the protagonist in this film is not a journalist but is taking a, more or less, journalistic exercise and trying his best to be impartial, bipartisan and a referee of sorts. In these times, though, there's less and less ground for such work in society. I don't care to lament that just for the sake of lamentation, but I truly think it's a loss to society if we leave no room for such work anymore.
