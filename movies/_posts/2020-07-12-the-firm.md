John Grisham fucking loves lawyering. Who is the John Grisham of software engineering? Who is the John Grisham of teachers, of firefighters, of grocery store workers? Maybe every profession needs a story teller who can talk about the values, ethics and culture of their industry. And maybe that person should love that profession as much as John Grisham loves lawyering (and hates basically everything else, including government).
