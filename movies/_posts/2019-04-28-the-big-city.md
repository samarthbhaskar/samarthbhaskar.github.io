<em>Oceans 8: Door to Door Saleswomen</em>

THe cost society bears for out-of-work men has been, and is, too high. Men's identities, and increasingly women's identities, are too tied up with work. It's really unfortunate we've build our world like this. 

Like other work by Satyajit Ray, the focus of this film is on family and society. And even as the man around Arati flounder and fail, she progresses with integrity, grit and focus. A heroine for our work-obsessed times.
