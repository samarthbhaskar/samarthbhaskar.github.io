I hadn't caught up with this film, although I love Julie Delpy, until recently. I was reminded of it because of this great <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/watching/lists/bechdel-test-movies-where-to-watch">list</a> of films currently streaming that pass the Bechdel Test. Delpy wrote, directed, edited and scored this film. That's an impressive accomplishment. 

The connections with Linklater's <em>Before</em> trilogy are apparent from the get-go in this film. We meet Jack and Marion on a train in Europe. And they spend much of the film walking, talking, arguing and discussing their relationship. However, if Linklater's films can be characterized with a central hopeful, if complicated, tone, Delpy goes in a more sardonic direction. It all works well in the end.
