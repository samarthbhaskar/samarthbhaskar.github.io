What's a thing that ages immediately because it is so packed with of-the-moment references that if you're watching it even a few months after release, it feels like re-trodding a meme from 50 years ago? Like the opposite of "timeless"? Anyway, I kept thinking that every time there was a hyper timely reference in this movie. 

Otherwise, a perfectly serviceable rom-com with some updated themes and character development.
