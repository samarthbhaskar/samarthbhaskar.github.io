[LetterboxD review link](https://letterboxd.com/samarthbhaskar/film/dave-chappelle-8-46/)

It is revealing to juxtapose this "special" with Dave's conversation with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okc6COsgzoE">Maya Angelou</a> from 7 or 8 years ago. There are strains of conversation about anger and bitterness. About intentionality. About being an engaged, global citizen. About the artist's responsibility. And, for Dave, about processing his feelings on stage with an audience present.
