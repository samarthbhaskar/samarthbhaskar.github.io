<em>Spider-man: Homecoming</em> is a high school comedy dressed in an ill-fitting superhero suit. The parts that amplify the high school comedy aspects of this movie fly, while the superhero parts mostly falter and fumble. This film featured one of the worst edited, most difficult to follow, final battle scenes of any films in the MCU cannon, that I can remember. Thankfully the balance is tilted in favor of the fun, often very funny, high school antics not so much the superhero stuff.

The story line, as thin as it maybe, though, points at some interesting ideas about GenX'ers blaming millennials for their problems, when in fact millennials are on their side, and their beef is actually with elite GenX'ers.
