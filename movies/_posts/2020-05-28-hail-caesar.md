Rewatching this and <em>A Serious Man</em> a few weeks from each other made for an interesting experience. The Coen's seem to have a deep nihilism at their core. But, somehow, it's so aesthetically well-rendered that you walk away feeling like you're a freshman in high school and a cool senior has taken an interest in you and taken you under her wing. I don't feel their nihilism makes for a feeling like you're losing something morally. It's more like, "who cares about morals in a world like this."
