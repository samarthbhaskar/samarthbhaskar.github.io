The <em>Bling Ring</em> showed up on a number of best of 2010s lists and I caught up with it after missing it the first time around. There's something perfectly depraved about its tone that captures the depravity of this era of tabloid and Instagram culture. Along with <em>Ingrid Goes West</em>, which had a different but also accurate tone, this is definitely a film for the 2010s.
