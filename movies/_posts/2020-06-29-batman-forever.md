When I moved to the US as a child in the late 90s, I made friends with a neighborhood kid who absolutely loved this movie. I was in an all out war against my own identity, fighting on the side of Become American, so I adopted his favorite movie as mine, too. We watched this movie a lot. Over pizza after an afternoon at the pool. To kick-off a sleepover. After waking up from a sleepover. Then I went 20 years without seeing it. 

On a recent rewatch, it's hard to believe how seriously I used to take this movie. It's so arch. So campy. But, alas, when you're a kid, learning about a new culture, you just take it at face value. Or maybe, in this case, at butt value.
