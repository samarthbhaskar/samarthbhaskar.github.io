 <em>The Girl on the Train</em> is purportedly about an idea. What is the anatomy of a lie? When does it succeed? When does it fail? And what is interesting about each kind of a lie: a successful one or a failing one? That's an interesting premise, but this film doesn't quite turn it into an interesting story.
