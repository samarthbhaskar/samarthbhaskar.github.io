Yahya Abdul-Mateen II and Mark Rylance's acting kept me going for a while. Then Michael Keaton showed up and that helped, too. Everything else felt over-determined and over-wrought, and pretty exhausting. Inculding Sacha Baron Cohen's very distracting accent. 

I watched the West Wing Special on HBO last week. I've been hinking back on watching all of The West Wing after working on a presidential campaign in 2012, especially because I've been working on presidential campaign work this year. I'm just not sure Sorkin's version of politics is very useful anymore.
