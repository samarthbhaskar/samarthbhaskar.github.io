10 months into the pandemic, watching middle aged men having long dinners, bullshitting, drinking together gave me actual, bodily, pain longing for dinners like that with my friends. This movie also captured the particular experience of masculinity that disallows men from using words to process pain together. It is one among many things about masculinity that would be better if we found a way to work past it. 

The Mikkelsen performance is as good as everyone says, and the final sequence is sublime. But I was more impressed with the first few acts where he finds a way to be dynamic and interesting while playing a character who is exactly the opposite of that.
