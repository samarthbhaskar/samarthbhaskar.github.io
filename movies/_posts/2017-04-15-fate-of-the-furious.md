I'd probably watch a full movie about zombie cars. Especially if it was about economic anxiety and the role of automation in job loss. Late market capitalism, labor management, political economy, protectionism -- scary stuff.

Possible titles:
<em>FED and the Furious</em> 
<em>Fast and Anti-Fragile</em>
<em>Hacked and Furious</em>
<em>Fast and Full Employment</em>
