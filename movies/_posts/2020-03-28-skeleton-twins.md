Watching this during the era of Coronavirus, after teaching a number of students who moved back home with their parents and families and I can't help but think this movie really nailed some of the particularities about the moving back home dynamic. 

Anyway, even outside of all that, it's just fun to hang out with Bill Hader and Kristen Wiig for a couple of hours.
