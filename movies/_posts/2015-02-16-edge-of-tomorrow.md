[LetterboxD review link](http://letterboxd.com/samarthbhaskar/film/edge-of-tomorrow/)

 The main conceit of this film required a lot of exposition. However, any more exposition in this film and it would've been too much. At the same time, I still felt lost even in the middle of the 3rd act. That's a tough place to corner yourself into as a writer and film-maker. I'm not one to argue that some things are too complicated to convey in a 2-hour film, but I think the task went past what this film could do.

I also don't think the film needed to turn Tom Cruise's character into a saved, loving person. Or that he and Emily Blunt needed to develop a romantic relationship. Sometimes, its just okay for a guy and a girl to be friends.
