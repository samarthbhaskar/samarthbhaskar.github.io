The best Black Mirror episode, ever.

It's amazing what some time and distance can do for a futuristic story. Seeing this again, for the first time since it debuted in 2013, so much of the story changed from technotopian to techno- and future-phobic. Knowing what I know now about how Facebook, Twitter, Google, Apple and other companies use information about me against me, and how the incentive structures of capitalism work, it seems almost inevitable that I'll someday have to do emotional work as the result of a decision made by a piece of technology. That's a strange idea. 

Beyond the technotopian or technophobic themes, I like Spike Jonze's exploration of the life cycles of relationships. An area he has explored before, with films like <em>Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind</em>, the story we tell ourselves about an experience depends greatly on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peak%E2%80%93end_rule">peaks and ends</a>. An analysis of this film, charting the emotional journey of its characters, would probably show that we spend a lot of time in the peaks and ends of this relationship. And that those are the most impactful parts of the film, and in extension of the story Theodore tells himself about his relationship. This film has brilliant uses of montages, music and depicts the passing of time in fascinating ways.
