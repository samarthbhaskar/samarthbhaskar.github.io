Despite having a huge back, Affleck had a hard time carrying this entire movie on his own. Compared to <em>Warrior</em>, a fantastic film, <em>The Way Back</em> feels way heavier on its feet. The basketball scenes are done well enough to make that part engaging. But, again, <em>Warrior</em>'s fight sequences were some of the best choreographed athletics on screen I've ever seen. 

Let's see if Gavin O'Connor can find his...way back...to those heights.
