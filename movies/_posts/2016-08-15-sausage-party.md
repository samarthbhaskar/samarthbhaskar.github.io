 <em>Sausage Party</em> is a <em>Team America: World Police</em>-esque, pun-filled, adult humor riddled, comedy that doubles as a atheist polemic parable for modern day man-children. That makes it sound like a pretty specific movie but, somehow, it sort of works. I didn't find it as smart (maybe wise-ass is a better word) as Trey Parker and Matt Stone's work in <em>South Park: Bigger, Longer, Uncut</em> or <em>Team America: World Police</em>. Their work tends to have a more fully formed world view and a stronger politics at its center. <em>Sausage Party</em>'s sense of polemics felt slightly shoe-horned. The film-makers' first and foremost goal, it is clear, was puns, toilet jokes, dick jokes and the like. And they're pretty good at that.
