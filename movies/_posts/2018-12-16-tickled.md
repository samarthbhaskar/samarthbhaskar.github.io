A second watch is not nearly as rewarding, because once you know the reveal, you really can't get lost in the story telling like you can the first time. I also have a feeling that the filmmakers discovered the final reveal (the "hidden" documents on the web server) much earlier than the story leads us to believe. In any case, it was fun to watch with someone who hadn't seen it before and to track her journey through the story.
