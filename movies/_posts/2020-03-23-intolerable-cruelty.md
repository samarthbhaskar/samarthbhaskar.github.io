Over the course of the Coen Brothers' filmography, we've started to piece together their true and unabiding belief in a nihlistic, world without reason, evil without a plan worldview. That world view works very well for deep, probing philosophical films like <em>A Serious Man</em> or even larks like <em>Burn After Reading</em>. But, it seems, it doesn't quite work for a romantic film. This film just needs more sap than the Coen Brothers have to offer, I fear.
