 Sometimes an author finds source material so interesting and remarkable on its face, they forget to do the work of finding something noteworthy to say about it. The family at the center of <em>The Wolfpack</em> is remarkable in and of itself. But I would think that if I read about them in the Metro section of the New York Times. To make a feature length documentary, the author needed to ask and (at least partially) answer some questions, that ultimately, she never gets to in this film.

I found many parts of the film fascinating - from the brothers' relationships with each other, with their mother, to their burgeoning rejection of their father, and of course their fascination with films (especially Tarantino and Nolan, arguably some of the most masculine film makers, making movies for young men). But there was so much more I wanted to know about their father, who largely gets off the hook here.
