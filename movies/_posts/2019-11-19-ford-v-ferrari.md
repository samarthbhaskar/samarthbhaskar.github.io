[LetterboxD review link]()

Jon Bernthal plays Lee Iococca in this film, a marketing genius, who is responsible for bringing Carol Shelby to Henry Ford. He also went on to invent the minivan in the 1980s. When I was a teenager, his autobiography was my favorite book. I have no idea why.

Also, Tracy Letts sobs in a race car and it's...perfect?
