My first time seeing this chamber-piece classic. Tim Curry really carries the whole thing on his back. I spent much of the time admiring the blocking of scenes and transitions in this film. It's not easy to manage that many characters on screen, with few cuts, in one house and give the audience a chance to connect with the characters, follow the story and maintain a sense of space. The director did an impressive job balancing these things.

The story, however, is not as engaging as I would've expected from the reputation that this murder-mystery-comedy has had since the 80s.
