Andrew Haigh's <em>Weekend</em> and <em>45 Years</em> are some of my favorite films of the last few years. <em>Lean on Pete</em> doesn't rise to the level of those film, but it packs similar emotional weight and meaning. Haigh, like Haneke, treats his viewer with respect. There is no condescension in his film making. Unlike Haneke, though, Haigh seems to care, at least a little, about protecting the viewers feelings.
