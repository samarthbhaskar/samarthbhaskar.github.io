When the opening titles started, and the Disney theme started playing, I wondered if we had put on the wrong movie. But then over the course of the film, the Disney feel-good-sports-movie fingerprints were abundantly clear. I don't know of any other examples of international films in which Disney has played such a role. It seems there's a lot of cinema out in the world that Disney could get involved in. Of course I'd prefer that Disney just provide their money and keep their artistic guidance to a minimum, but that's not really the way of the world is it.

I enjoyed the film, although some of my regular gripes with Bollywood films (mostly the length) could be leveled against this film too. This time, however, I also wondered when we'd get the American remake starring The Rock, Kate and Rooney Mara and Timoth√©e Chalamet as a young Omkar.
