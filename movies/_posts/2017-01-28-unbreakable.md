Like some others, I came back to rewatch this after seeing <a href="http://letterboxd.com/samarthbhaskar/film/split-2016/">Split</a> this week. After the last 6-8 years of superhero movies, I think we should give M. Night credit for pre-empting this genre with a great superhero entry. The premise -- what if superheroes were already here, living among us, they just didn't know -- is fascinating. And this film sees it through to great success. 

Bruce Willis also turned in a great performance here. From the first scene in the train to one of the final scenes at the breakfast table with his son, the development of his inner life his just as intersting as his transition into superhero.
