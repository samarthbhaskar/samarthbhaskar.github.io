<em>Trading Places</em> is a defining film for its era. It centrally features the financialization of the economy, urban decay and inequality, Eddie Murphy in a starring role, and even throws in black face lest you think it is too modern. It may be the best film ever made about the central questions of social science: is it nature or nurture that makes us who we are?
