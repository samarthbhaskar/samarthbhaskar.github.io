I'm not automatically averse of hyper-stylized violence, I like movies like <em>John Wick</em> but <em>Brawl in Cell Block 99</em> was too much for me to handle. It was just, too intense, too violent, and lacking any intellectual weight for me to find it enjoyable. But it was cool, I guess, to see Vince Vaughn in a role that used his height and size for full effect. And a role that didn't rely on his quick-wit and motormouth shtick, like many of his previous roles have.
