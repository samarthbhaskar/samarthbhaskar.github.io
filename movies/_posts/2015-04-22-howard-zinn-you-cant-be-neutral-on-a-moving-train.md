As far as documentaries go, this wasn't all that special. But as far as public intellectuals go, Howard Zinn was singular. A Marxian historian, who somehow penetrated public consciousness year after year, writing seminal popular works, producing high quality academic literature, and participating in all the major issues of his time. 

Before this documentary, most of my knowledge about Zinn came from his famous work A People's History. I didn't know about his background at Spellman college in the 60s, his participation in anti-war protests in Vietnam, or his activism in the 80s and 90s. I'm glad this documentary captured his time as a public figure.
