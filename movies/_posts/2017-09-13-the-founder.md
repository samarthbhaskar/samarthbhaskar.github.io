"If you invented McDonald's, you would have invented McDonald's" -- not an actual line of dialog but could've been.

There are a couple of times when I busted up laughing out loud because a milk shake was framed by breasts. Or a woman was taking a slow-motion, salacious bite out of a hamburger. And I just couldn't handle it.
