The lead and supporting performances, the camera work, editing and sound mixing are all top notch here.

If films are to be judged by how powerfully they evoke emotions -- and this film is very powerful at evoking disgust, rancor, and acidity, or at lest portraying it -- then this is a very successful film. But I think an amoral sense of power to evoke something, ultimately, feels unsatisfying.
