<em>Mank</em> contains lots of interesting ideas about politics, media, authorship, transitional moments in modernity, writing and other topics but it was sorely lacking an emotional core. Ironic, given that the film it spends its entire runtime reminding us of solved exactly that problem as successfully as its ever been solved.
