I know Dakota Johnson is actually Melanie Griffith's daughter, but I think Aubrey Plaza has a better claim to make as our generation's Melanie Griffith. Their deadpan, slow drawl, muted acting styles are uncannily matched. Anyway, that's not really about the movie. 

Demme's use of music in this film, which I believe is one big reason it made into the Criterion collection, was my favorite part. There's a brief, but electric cover of "I'm a Believe" by The Feelies, and of course their cover of "Fame" that are worth watching the film in and of themselves. 

The plot is slightly scattershot and the story-telling gets a bit out of hand in the 2nd half but it was an enjoyable ride through the role of lying in modern American relationships.
