Although Chappelle is more comfortable on stage in this special, than <em><a href="https://letterboxd.com/samarthbhaskar/film/dave-chappelle-the-age-of-spin/">Age of Spin</a></em>, the material in this special is less bold. Structurally, in topic choice, cadence and feel, everything about this special feels a little more casual. I suppose that's only fit for a place like Texas. Still, when Chappelle is on stage, fireworks and lightning are to be expected. And that's what he delivers.
