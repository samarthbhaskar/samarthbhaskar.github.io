An able homage to Wong Kar Wai, Hou Hsiao Hsien, and a number of other directors. But, I can't help but feel that Netflix didn't give this film the amount of edits and versions it needed to become a good film. It's too bad, really, because it seems there's a good movie in here. But there's just not enough here to truly walk away feeling a sense of satisfaction.
