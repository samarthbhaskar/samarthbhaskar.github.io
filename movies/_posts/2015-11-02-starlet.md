 A great example of what independent cinema can do - take a simple story, a couple of characters drawn with feeling, all placed in a realistic environment, and tell that story without too many distractions. 

This is perhaps the story of the porn industry that PT Anderson would tell if he were making Boogie Nights today, instead of in the 1990s.
