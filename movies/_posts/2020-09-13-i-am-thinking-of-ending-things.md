I enjoyed the two long car ride scenes. And all the commentary about culture, especially film, as an ingredient in modern (especially male) identity formation. But then the last act was tough to hang with. 

As my partner said, this would pair well with HIGH FIDELITY. It also made me want to re-watch WILD ROSE.
