Elise and I were in the mood to watch a Miyazaki film, but his films are difficult to find on streaming platforms. So we settled for this, a knock-off of sorts.

The biblical and fairy tale themes are interesting but weren't enough to sustain the energy needed for a feature length film. I wasn't sold on this as much as some of the other viewers on LetterboxD.
