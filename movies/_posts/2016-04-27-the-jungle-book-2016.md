[LetterboxD review link](http://letterboxd.com/samarthbhaskar/film/the-jungle-book-2016/)

 I originally wrote a longer review of this film that lobbed insults like "anodyne", "politically bereft", "lacking a point of view" and "unsure who it is for or what it is about". But then I took a few days to think about it and came down on the side of "who cares". 

Billy Murray's baloo is funny and heart-warming, Ben Kingsley's bagheera is reserved and intellectual. Neel Sethi's acting will make you believe that Jacob Tremblay in <em>Room</em> really is in a category of his own as a child actor.
