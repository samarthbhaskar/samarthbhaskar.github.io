There are a couple of scenes in <em>Mangrove</em> where Steve McQueen's true talent -- burrowing inside a character's head and depicting it perfectly on screen so the viewer feels like they're seeing the story through McQueen's glasses -- is on display. There's a scene where Crichlow and his coworkers are dancing and singing in the kitchen just before the Mangrove opens. And another when Crichlow is thrown into a holding pen under the Old Bailey. <em>Mangrove</em> needed more scenes and moments like this.
