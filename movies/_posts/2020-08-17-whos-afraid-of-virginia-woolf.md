A classic I had never caught up with until now. And wow, I'm bowled over. Elizabeth Taylor's performance, not to forget every other performance, Mike Nichols' confidence as a debut director, the beautiful cinematography, the blocking that leaves you knowing exactly where you are in each room and feeling the walls close in, the control in editing to leave the shot alone and let the actors and dialog take the reins -- it's all very very impressive. 

The theme I was left thinking about the most, probably because of the current political and news environment, was generational conflict. The film might be a better depition of the inevitability of history than any other piece of art I've come across recently. 

Also, quarantine life for the last 5 months has made me so thirsty for socializing that one of the thoughts I had while watching this movie was: "ok this is bad, but look, they're drinking together! Indoors!"
