I loved Johnson's <em><a href="https://letterboxd.com/samarthbhaskar/film/cameraperson/">Cameraperson</a></em> a few years ago. The subject matter, editing and tone really stuck with me. And <em>Dick Johnson</em> is a fantastic follow up. I look forward to seeing how Johnson continues to evolve the genre of docu-memoir over her lifetime. 

When Aziz Ansari was on press tour for one of the Master of None seasons, he told a story about appearing on Colbert with his dad. After the apperance, Aziz asked his dad if he had fun doing a major late night TV show. His dad said something like, "sure, yeah, it was fun, but honestly my favorite part about doing your show and going on this press tour is spending more time with you." I thought of that story throughout this film. Why would an aging man agree to depict his death on screen dozens of times? Because his daughter asked him to. And it was a clever way to spend more time together as the clock runs out.
