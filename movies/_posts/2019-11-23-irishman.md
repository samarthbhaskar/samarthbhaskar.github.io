Using a map and a road trip as a clock device, the stories within stories (the most compelling of which were monologues between characters, sometimes in their pajamas!), literally everything Joe Pesci does when he's on screen (how he can control my emotion as a viewer with the slightest of facial ticks is beyond impressive), Scorcese's self-aware acceptance of his own mortality but also obsession with it, and the face that he's in on the joke often times ("this should take 3 hours, tops"); there's a lot to love about <em>The Irishman</em>. 

I don't think this is my favorite of Scorcese/De Niro's work, but it is memorable as part of their journey through their careers together.
