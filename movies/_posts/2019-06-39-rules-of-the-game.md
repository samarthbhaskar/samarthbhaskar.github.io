Is it a compliment to a film that it feels ahead of its time or that it feels modern even though it was made in an earlier era? I don't know if that in and of itself is a feature of all great films, but it is a feature of this film. A film made in 1939 that feels like it could've been made in the 1970s or 80s. 

For me, the most interesting parts were the comparisons to <em>Roma</em>, one of my favorite films of the last few years. The ensemble scenes, character and space management and advancement of the plot and emotion through active hunting sequences were great comparable points. Watching this film gave me another reason to appreciate <em>Roma</em>.
