 Along with 25th Hour and Do The Right Thing, this is one of the tightest scripts Spike Lee has probably worked with. I don't think he really believed in the movie, though, so there are only sprinklings of his directorial touches and talents on display. For the most part, he just let the script and the actors carry the film, which is ok. Not every project can animate a director equally.

This is one of those movies that makes it abundantly clear how heavy-handed Hollywood believes it needs to be, in order to convey its point. The same script, same actors, even same director, without the burden of Hollywood's expectations would probably have produced a much less ham-handed film.
