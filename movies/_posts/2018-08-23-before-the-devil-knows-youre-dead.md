[LetterboxD review link](https://letterboxd.com/samarthbhaskar/film/before-the-devil-knows-youre-dead/)

Philip Seymour Hoffman's acting. Ethan Hawke's acting. Marisa Tomei's acting. Michael Shannon. Amy Ryan. There's just so much good acting in this film. A modern tragedy captured on film by a man nearing the end of his life and seeing the rot in American society.

Ethan Hawke, who is perpetually playing seekers on screen, men who are unsure of themselves, looking for affirmation and belonging plays perfectly off of PSH. The tragedy in real life, as we learned later, is that PSH's brokenness was on display here, too.
