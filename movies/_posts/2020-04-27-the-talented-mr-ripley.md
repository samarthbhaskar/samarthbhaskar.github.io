The source material is largely to thank for the success of this movie. But I couldn't help but feel that there was a sorely missing screen-writing element that was missing here. This, more than most other literary adaptations, felt like reading a book rather than watching a movie. And it wasn't for a lacking of visual or cinematic depth. Hard to put my finger on it, exactly, but I guess what's what good screen writing is about. 

Anyway, Matt Damon and Gwyneth Paltrow have basically built entire careers out of these types of characters. And this movie is an impressive entry in the genre.
