 15th anniversary screening at NYFF. The actors, directors and cinematographer were in attendance and had a nice Q&A afterward. I continue to hold the Coen brothers in high regard, not least because of their consistency and most because of the complete control they have over their ideas and execution. We could all aspire to set and live up to such high standards.
