Re-watched after recently seeing <em>Palm Springs</em>. It's notable that beyond a masterful execution of its premise, some fantastic performances, being very funny and having lots of heart, there's kind of a simple message at the core of this film. "Be Nice," is kind of an epitome of anodyne 80's/90's Hollywood messages.
