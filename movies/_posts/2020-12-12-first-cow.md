Someone recently said (I forget where) that Kelly Reichardt makes movies about American failure. I think that's a great way to describe her film making. And a necessary corrective to the majority of American cinema, and American culture, which is obsessed with success, American success or otherwise. Capitalism, however, especially the American kind, creates way more failures in its wake than successes. 

The core failure in this film, then, might be the first failure in America: a failure of friendship.
