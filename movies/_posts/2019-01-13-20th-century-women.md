A rewatch after not seeing it for a while and it was rewarding. Knowing that the tone of this film was more "memoir" than "novel" really helped put me in the right frame as a viewer the 2nd time around. Each scene and memory can be properly treated as an anecdote that is meant to convey a feeling about growing up, not just for Jamie but for every character in this film. 

Lucas Jade Zumann walked to Timothee Chalamet and Lucas Hedges could run.
