There are entire chunks of this movie, with pivotal plot developments, entirely missing. I'm not asking for a Christopher Nolan or Katherine Bigelow level screen-writing, but maybe just an explanation of how these two people went from meeting each other in a bathroom line to sleeping together. That doesn't seem like much to ask.
