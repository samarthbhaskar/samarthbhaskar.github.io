 <em>Blue Ruin</em> was one of my favorite films of 2013. I was immediately impressed with Macon Blair and Jeremy Saulnier. Going in to <em>Green Room</em>, I had no idea they were back together and going further down the path of exploring violence. I was hesitant to see this film, in all honesty, because the trailer made it seem like a horror or gore filled film, the kind I usually stay away from. But as soon as Macon Blair came on screen, my attention was focused. 

<em>Green Room</em> is a seat-gripping ride that takes little time to turn up to 9, then 10, then 11. The use of violence was central to this film. Violence, in and of itself, is sometimes interesting but it becomes all the more interesting when it is used in service of something larger. Saulnier seems to be using violence as a method of exploring humanity in this film. He is focused on how violence compounds on itself, how it relies on a failure of humanity, and what it means for us to aspire morality while violence exists all around us. 

<em>Green Room</em> accomplished some of these things better than others, but Saulnier is well suited for success in this vein. As long as he keeps partnering with Macon Blair, who is perhaps one of the best conduits for morality and violence acting today.
