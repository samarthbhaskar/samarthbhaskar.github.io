 Not as much of an exploration of authenticity in documentary as STORIES WE TELL but it was up there. Burre has a quality that I often pick up on when I'm hanging out with "theater-types." They seem to be hyper aware that someone is watching, even if no one is watching. This quality is even more heightened when a camera is around. Sometimes I wonder if they can even control this, or if this is what led them to acting in the first place.
