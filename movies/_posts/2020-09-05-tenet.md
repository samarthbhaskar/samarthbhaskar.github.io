"It's hard to trust someone who's telling you half truths." 

Nolan has primed me to be skeptical from the first frame. Some amount of lying might be "standard operating procedure" in story telling, in exchange for entertainment or a narrative journey, but there seems to be little depth or point to this story besides Nolan's interest in conveying novel ideas about time.

Sometimes, watching Nolan films feels like going to a Sharper Image store. Everything is cool, glossy, chrome but cold and useless.
