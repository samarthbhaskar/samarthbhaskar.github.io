<em>Batman - The Killing Joke</em> somehow gives Barbara Gordon half the runtime on screen and fails to give her character full treatment. Besides the prologue (can we really call the first half of a movie, as unconnected as it is, a prologue?), the story of Joker's origin and relationship with Batman is fascinating. 

In a time when chaos, upheaval, and anti-institutionalism are taking hold around the world, it was interesting to see that dynamic depicted on screen with Commissioner Gordon and Batman on one side and the Joker on the other. And to see an exploration of the dualism that defines Batman and Joker's relationship. The writing in the second half of this film, especially near the end, is sharp. The animation (save some moments where the use of lighting is done well) is mostly pedestrian.
