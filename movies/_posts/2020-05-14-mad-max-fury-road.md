[LetterboxD review link](https://letterboxd.com/samarthbhaskar/film/mad-max-fury-road/1/)

This NYT <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/12/movies/mad-max-fury-road-oral-history.html">oral history</a> reminded me to rewatch this absolute banger of a film. Not a wasted shot. Not a moment that doesn't pay off. My original review was not quite on point, this movie ended up having a much bigger mark on the genre and has only become more impressive with time.
