 <em>Something, Anything</em>'s set design was impressive. It captured what so much of middle-America looks like. The bath towels, the faux art from Michael's or Hobby Lobby, tea cups, knives, forks and spoons from Ikea or Bed, Bath and Beyond. The 5-8 year old cars. Clothes from Kohl's. It's not so easy to capture on screen things that tend to just bleed into background in our lives.

Beyond that, and maybe the central performance by Ashley Shelton, there wasn't much that I found impressive about this film.
