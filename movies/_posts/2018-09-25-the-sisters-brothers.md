Listen, as soon as I saw <em>A Prophet</em> I knew I would show up for anything and everything directed by Jacques Audiard. <em>Dheepan</em> redoubled my commitment. So when I heard Audiard was releasing his first English language film with John C. Reilly and Joaquin Phoenix, two of the best male actors working today, I was in. Much to my surprise, Jake Gyllenhaal and Riz Ahmed also showed up and put in great performances. 

There are some interesting themes about competition, modernity, the awkwardness of living during a time of transition (from the Wild West to modernity) but they're never fully or convincingly explored. The ending, a high risk attempt, doesn't really pay off in my opinion. But this film is still memorable for its performances, and for a scene where John C. Reilly tells the story of his horse dying which will leave you in tears. 

Whatever Audiard makes next, I'll be there.
