It's shocking, in some ways, that Spike Lee made <em>She's Gotta Have It</em> in 1986 and followed it up with <em>School Daze</em> in 1988 and <em>Do The Right Thing</em> in 1989. That's a pretty remarkable growth trajectory for a young film maker. And in this film, in particular, you can see the raw ambition of a young director who has spent hours watching French New Wave, Woody Allen films and so on. The story, here, is not complex. And he has taken on the subject of black womens' sexuality and sexual power in other places (never really all that convincingly, I might add), but there are some interesting aspects to the film. The Fab 5 Freddie cameo, early on, and the Alvin Ailey choreographed dance halfway through were some of my favorite parts.
