I go about NYC with headphones in, keeping my head down, trying to stay out of people' way, minding my own business. Crystal Moselle goes about NYC meeting kids on the subway and creating movies like <em>The Wolfpack</em> and <em>Skate Kitchen</em>. She's clearly winning the contest of how best to live in NYC.

2018 skate movies ranked: <em>Minding the Gap</em> > <em>Skate Kitchen</em>, <em>Mid 90s</em>.
