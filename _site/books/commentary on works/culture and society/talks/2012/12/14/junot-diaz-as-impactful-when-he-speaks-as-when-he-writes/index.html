<p>Junot Diaz, author of the highly acclaimed <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Drown-Junot-Diaz/dp/1573226068/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1355470859&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=drown">Drown</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Brief-Wondrous-Life-Oscar-Wao/dp/1594483299/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1355470911&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=brief+wondrous+life+of+oscar+wao">The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao</a> and the recently released <a href="http://www.amazon.com/This-How-You-Lose-Her/dp/1594487367/ref=sr_1_7?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1355470911&amp;sr=1-7&amp;keywords=brief+wondrous+life+of+oscar+wao">This is How You Lose Her</a>, is amazingly eloquent as a speaker. He carries over his intelligence, charm, wit, humor, empathy and insight from the page to the interview set quite seamlessly.</p>
<p>I have watched a handful of really interesting interviews with Diaz discussing his experiences as a writer, an academic, a cultural critic and all the various roles he has taken on in his life. A common thread between all of the clips is his ability to construct a thought with precision and insight that is emblematic of a highly matured thought process. He hardly fails, even in sentences that seem to be off-the-cuff or filler, to convey a cogent and considered thought. After spending a year surrounded by mainstream political rhetoric, which even at its finest can be less than evocative and often repeats familiar patterns, I am perhaps more impressed than an average viewer with Diaz's oratory. It also doesn't hurt that I've devoured his writing in the last few years and thought highly of him as a cultural icon for hyphenated-Americans.</p>
<p>None the less, I hope to learn from him. Learn to speak as deeply as I think. Maybe I should start by thinking deeply first.</p>
