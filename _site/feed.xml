                <title>A Marxian reading of Technology</title>
                        
                
                    <description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight I attended my first meeting of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jacobinmag.com/&quot;&gt;Jacobin Magazine&lt;/a&gt; reading group. Jacobin Magazine is a leading leftist magazine, providing cultural, social and political commentary from a polemical leftist perspective. The reading group meets once a month in Brooklyn and provides a semi-structured conversation for readers of the magazine. This month’s topic was technology. And tonight’s readings were &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jacobinmag.com/2015/04/braverman-gramsci-marx-technology/&quot;&gt;Technology and Socialist Strategy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jacobinmag.com/2015/03/socialism-innovation-capitalism-smith/&quot;&gt;Red Innovation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
