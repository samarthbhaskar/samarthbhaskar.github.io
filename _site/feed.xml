                <title>Black Lives Matter Reading List</title>
                        
                
                    <description>&lt;p&gt;Lately, I’ve been participating in discussions (online and in person) about Black Lives Matter, police brutality, protests, and race relations. In one of these discussions, a friend brought up the frustration she feels when talking about these topics with friends and family who are less than sympathetic to the argument put forth by the Black Lives Matter movement. In her own words:&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>A Marxian reading of Technology</title>
                        
                
                    <description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight I attended my first meeting of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jacobinmag.com/&quot;&gt;Jacobin Magazine&lt;/a&gt; reading group. Jacobin Magazine is a leading leftist magazine, providing cultural, social and political commentary from a polemical leftist perspective. The reading group meets once a month in Brooklyn and provides a semi-structured conversation for readers of the magazine. This month’s topic was technology. And tonight’s readings were &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jacobinmag.com/2015/04/braverman-gramsci-marx-technology/&quot;&gt;Technology and Socialist Strategy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jacobinmag.com/2015/03/socialism-innovation-capitalism-smith/&quot;&gt;Red Innovation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>The Problem of Value - Economics as a Moral Science</title>
                        
                
                    <description>&lt;p&gt;A couple of weeks ago, the New York Review of Books Foundation held a conference about economics. The title of the conference was “What’s Wrong with the Economy and with Economics?” The conference featured academics and public intellectuals giving short talks and engaging in debates about modern day macro-economic trends. All the videos from the conference are available on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nybooks.com/blogs/gallery/2015/mar/29/whats-wrong-with-the-economy/&quot;&gt;NYRB&lt;/a&gt; site.&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>Kendrick Lamar - To Pimp a Butterfly</title>
                        
                
                    <description>&lt;p&gt;Earlier this week, Kendrick Lamar released his much anticipated and long-awaited follow up to “good kid, m.A.A.d city,” called “To Pimp a Butterfly.” The album has been showered with early praise. Lamar has done a few interviews, including this one in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/22/arts/music/kendrick-lamar-on-his-new-album-and-the-weight-of-clarity.html?_r=0&amp;amp;pagewanted=all&quot;&gt;New York Times&lt;/a&gt; that situates him among “prophetic witnesses” like Sam Cooke, Marvin Gaye, and Curtis Mayfield.&lt;/p&gt;

His assignment has been to trace the paths that Vikings and early Norwegians took in America, first arriving in Newfoundland and then settling in mainland America.&lt;/p&gt;

                    <description>&lt;p&gt;As a follow up to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://samarthbhaskar.com/2015/02/19/what-isis-really-wants/&quot;&gt;ISIS response&lt;/a&gt; I posted last week, here’s an &lt;a href=&quot;http://muse.jhu.edu/login?auth=0&amp;amp;type=summary&amp;amp;url=/journals/international_security/v039/39.3.ahmad.html&quot;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; that I came across today. The abstract below states the main conceit, which is that Islamists have a structural advantage in selling security services in the conflict security market.&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>Response to &quot;What ISIS really wants&quot;</title>
                        
                
                    <description>&lt;p&gt;The Atlantic had a cover story last month, which now looks to be deprecated. But here’s a &lt;a href=&quot;http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:http://www.theatlantic.com/features/archive/2015/02/what-isis-really-wants/384980/&quot;&gt;cached version&lt;/a&gt;. The story was about ISIS and its religious underpinnings. My friend Arjun and I discussed it over email last night and I wanted to share some of my thoughts here. I’ve pasted my email to him below:&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>Some thoughts on newsroom analytics</title>
                        
                
                    <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently left my job at &lt;a href=&quot;www.etsy.com&quot;&gt;Etsy&lt;/a&gt; as a data analyst to join the newsroom at the &lt;a href=&quot;www.nytimes.com&quot;&gt;New York Times&lt;/a&gt;. In addition to being sad to leave Etsy, and learning &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt; in my 2 years there, I’m very excited to work with talented journalists and technologists at the Times to help usher the organization into a new era.&lt;/p&gt;
