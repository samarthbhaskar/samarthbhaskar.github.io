  <h1 class="post-title">Knausgaard on immigration</h1>
  <span class="post-date">15 Mar 2015</span>
  <p>In <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/15/magazine/karl-ove-knausgaards-passage-through-america.html?hp&amp;action=click&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;module=second-column-region&amp;region=top-news&amp;WT.nav=top-news&amp;_r=1&amp;pagewanted=all">part 2</a> of Karl Ove Knausgaard&#39;s NYTimes magazine feature, the author - most famously of a 6-part <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Struggle_%28Knausg%C3%A5rd_novels%29">memoir</a> - writes about immigration. His assignment has been to trace the paths that Vikings and early Norwegians took in America, first arriving in Newfoundland and then settling in mainland America. </p>

<p>Karl Ove is still uncomfortable in America. He&#39;s still unsure what to even make of his journey. But one thing is clear, his time in America is going to be spent as a Norwegian and will most likely be limited. That emotional distance allows him to think critically about American culture and American emigration. </p>

<p>This definition of culture, especially in the context of an American immigrant trying to assimilate, rung very true for me.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What is culture, if not a set of prejudices? A set of unformulated and unconscious rules and ways of behavior that every member of a given society nonetheless immediately recognizes and accepts?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Karl Ove is thinking of and writing about his ancestors and older family members settling here. This is exactly the kind of cultural shift I went through as an immigrant. In fact, my family and I ended up at the end of that transition absorbing all manner of American prejudices, a lot of which were targeted right back at Indian-American immigrants. That&#39;s something about immigrant communities I have never understood - how quick we are to put down other immigrants behind us in the assimilation process. What a shame, that we can&#39;t extend courtesy and comfort to our compatriots, the same that we were denied merely a few years before.</p>
