<p>Happy birthday, President Obama.</p>
<p>When I woke up this morning,  birthdays weren’t on my mind. On my mind was the wonderful dinner I had  with an old friend last night that left a sweet taste of memories from  college and excitement for the future. On my mind was the fact that  these are the last few weeks of my summer internship in Washington D.C.  before I head back to Chicago for graduate school.</p>
<p>But thinking about birthdays, I can say, I’ve had some good ones in my life.</p>
<p><strong>2010:</strong> Spent  with new friends in Beirut, Lebanon while traveling in the Middle East  as a student. Saw the sun rise over the Mediterranean and ate some of  the best kanaffeh imaginable.</p>
<p><strong>2009:</strong> I got a  speeding ticket while driving to Columbia, Missouri to perform with my  best friends as part of a college a cappella group.</p>
<p><strong>2008:</strong> a huge surprise party organized by my mom in my house, featuring my closest friends from college and high school.</p>
<p><strong>2000:</strong> I had chickenpox and was cooped up in the house so my Dad snuck me out  while my mom set up a cake and some gifts (including more Calamine  lotion for the itching).</p>
<p><strong>1997:</strong> a pizza party at  Nirulas in New Delhi. (For those unfamiliar with late-1990’s New Delhi,  India, this place was the hot spot in town.) I felt very special as a  nine-year-old, with the entire top floor for my friends and family.</p>
<p><strong>1989:</strong> I can’t say I remember this birthday, as it was my first, but I have  been told some great stories about my mom cooking for 200 people who  partied on a rooftop and how my dad provided liquor for everyone even  though we lived in a dry-state in India.</p>
<p>Birthdays are tricky,  but I have learned that they’re akin to a lot of lived experience. You  have to manage expectations and also be able to draw meaning in ways  that work for you. Tracing back my birthday means more to me than just  the March 14th’s throughout the years. They’re a testament to the person  I was then, to the important people in my life which all has ultimately  helped me become who I am today.</p>
