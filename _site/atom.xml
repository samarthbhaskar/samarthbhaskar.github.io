   <title>On Kanye West and black ambition</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Kanye&amp;#39;s evolution&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Kanye.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Kanye West&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last week, Slate&amp;#39;s Arthur Chu wrote a piece called &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.salon.com/2015/02/17/kanye_west_vs_white_mediocrity_the_real_story_behind_beck_beyonce_and_snl_40/&quot;&gt;Kanye West Vs. White Mediocrity&lt;/a&gt;. This was on the heels of Kanye&amp;#39;s latest public appearences at the Grammys and SNL&amp;#39;s 40th anniversary. I had an email exchange about the topic that I&amp;#39;ll partially share here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of this reminded me of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZ0fRBtAB1w&quot;&gt;Chris Rock&amp;#39;s joke&lt;/a&gt; about mediocrity and black people being able to suck. He talks about how Joe Lewis (or someone) was fighting a white boxer and round after round, kicking this guy&amp;#39;s ass. And then in like the 13th round he finally knocks him out and wins the fight. When they went to the judges&amp;#39; cards, they had Joe Lewis losing the fight. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s kind of an interesting argument about resource constraints or opportunity constraints elevating quality. Maybe because there are so few spots for black artists and entertainers, there&amp;#39;s an artificial constraint that&amp;#39;s created. This, in turn, elevates quality. I mean, I&amp;#39;m all for higher quality, but I think there are more humane ways to achieve rather than racism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was thinking this during the SNL-40 show: everyone judges Kanye with a lot of baggage. During his performance I was texting with my sister (a huge Kanye fan), watching Twitter (where my networks are largely white, affluent, self-described liberals) - and I &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/samarthbhaskar/status/567168718648909825&quot;&gt;tweeted this&lt;/a&gt;. I think Chu addresses this in his article too, he said something like everyone is judging the thing he did last not what he&amp;#39;s doing right now. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perfectionism is exhausting/stressful. For Kanye to strive for perfection, for Michael Jackson to have done that, and Nina Simone, and James Baldwin and so many other people - there&amp;#39;s a real cost for this. People are driven into exhaustion, have to leave the country, or worse they pay with their lives. It&amp;#39;s really sad that all these artists want is to express themselves, to pursue their art but once they achieve a certain level of fame, perfection is the only option anymore. And then they end up driving themselves into the ground. And we think we&amp;#39;re rewarding them with our love and adoration, but we&amp;#39;re just feeding their addiction. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I like &amp;quot;whiteness is a roomier identity.&amp;quot; That was a nice way of capturing that sentiment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, I&amp;#39;ve had a change of heart about Kanye in the last year or so. I used to be the type of guy who&amp;#39;d say &amp;quot;ugh, I loved Kanye when he just stuck to backpack rap. His first few albums were so great. He should&amp;#39;ve just stuck to being a good producer.&amp;quot; I thought I was saying that as a critical consumer of his music, but I was doing exactly what this article is talking about. I was boxing him in, not allowing him to be a full person or a full artist. Now, I&amp;#39;m on board. I&amp;#39;m not uncritical, but I&amp;#39;m along for the ride. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Roxane Gay on Black Ambition&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/untamed_state.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;An Untamed State&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to my thoughts on Kanye, I&amp;#39;ve been thinking about a piece my sister shared with me by Roxane Gay. By the way, her debut novel &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1209677063&quot;&gt;An Untamed State&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; knocked me out. In this essay, Gay talks about acheiving success in her career as a writer and educator but never feeling comfortable with it. This is a pretty familiar mental model for me. For all the success I&amp;#39;ve acheived in life, it never feels like I was meant to be successful. I have to constantly remind myself that I earned the things I&amp;#39;ve earned. Certainly not without luck, fortune and support, but also not without hard work and tenacity. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of these thoughts are present in Kanye&amp;#39;s maturation. Kanye, more than any artist I know, is fighting to make his success a normal thing. Sometimes that means he&amp;#39;s reaching for bigger, bolder things. Sometimes that means he&amp;#39;s allowing himself the freedom that other successful people might have. If Donald Trump and Mitt Romney feel they can run for president because they were successful in private enterprise, Kanye feels similiary that he should be able to try his hand at fashion because of his success as a music producer. I don&amp;#39;t know if I agree with that basic approach, but I do support Kanye&amp;#39;s ability to do that as much as Trump or Romney are able to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;David Oyelowo on Obama&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Oyelowo.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;David Oyelowo&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://the-talks.com/interviews/david-oyelowo/&quot;&gt;David Oyelowo&lt;/a&gt; had a short interview during his post-Selma press rounds where he mentioned that Obama&amp;#39;s presidency has been a boone for Black narratives, actors and projects to get attention. This is not a new idea, but I liked that he got to tell President Obama about it. Despite being a hyper rational guy, I bet it was nice for Obama to hear that. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe Kanye, Roxange Gay, David Oyelowo and Barack Obama can be the models that the next generation of artists, authors, politicians can gather inspiration from.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>ISIS follow up - Islamist power in civil war</title>
   <link href="/2015/02/23/islamist-power-in-civil-war/"/>
   <updated>2015-02-23T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>/2015/02/23/islamist-power-in-civil-war</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;As a follow up to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://samarthbhaskar.com/2015/02/19/what-isis-really-wants/&quot;&gt;ISIS response&lt;/a&gt; I posted last week, here&amp;#39;s an &lt;a href=&quot;http://muse.jhu.edu/login?auth=0&amp;amp;type=summary&amp;amp;url=/journals/international_security/v039/39.3.ahmad.html&quot;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; that I came across today. The abstract below states the main conceit, which is that Islamists have a structural advantage in selling security services in the conflict security market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;In civil wars across the world, certain Islamist groups have competed exceptionally well against their rivals. The conventional wisdom points to either religion or ethnic politics to explain Islamist success. These ideological and identity-based explanations, however, tend to overlook the powerful economic influence that the local business class has over civil war outcomes. Civil war can be modeled as a market for security, wherein protection must be purchased from multiple substate rackets. Using this market model, a close investigation of the Somali case reveals why and under what conditions the interests of the profit-driven business class align with those of ideologically motivated Islamist groups. Security costs are of critical importance to businesses in a civil war, and Islamists are uniquely competitive in lowering these costs. The business-Islamist alliance is therefore driven by rational, economic considerations, which can contribute to the rise of Islamist power.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The general point made in this article comes on page 96:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Because Islamists are able to sell security across ethnic and tribal divisions, however, they can offer more competitive prices than groups that primarily sell protection to a narrower pool of prospective buyers. By charging lower margins across the board,Islamists have the ability to capture a larger share of the security market than ethnic or tribal groups. As their market share increases, they can lower their rates further to price out their rivals. Therefore, not only do Islamist groups give businesses the option to leave coercive relationships with ethnic or tribal protection rackets, but they also offer more competitive prices to do so&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This makes sense to me, and the case study of Somalia illustrates the point pretty well. Although there isn&amp;#39;t an official civil war in Syria/Iraq, citizens in the area dealing with ISIS based on rational models makes much more sense than most of the narratives in the media.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Response to "What ISIS really wants"</title>
   <link href="/2015/02/19/what-isis-really-wants/"/>
   <updated>2015-02-19T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>/2015/02/19/what-isis-really-wants</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The Atlantic had a cover story last month, which now looks to be deprecated. But here&amp;#39;s a &lt;a href=&quot;http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:http://www.theatlantic.com/features/archive/2015/02/what-isis-really-wants/384980/&quot;&gt;cached version&lt;/a&gt;. The story was about ISIS and its religious underpinnings. My friend Arjun and I discussed it over email last night and I wanted to share some of my thoughts here. I&amp;#39;ve pasted my email to him below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Princeton professor is a cool guy. If I remember correctly, he came to UIUC when I was studying Arabic/Middle Eastern studies and I enjoyed hearing him talk. There was a dude at UIUC who was very similar to him. Secular authority on Islam and Islamic history. The UIUC guy, Khalil, had some interesting things to say - he felt like he had to change the course of his research and scholarship to be more radicalism focused in order to compete for tenure track jobs. I think he was much more interested in other things about the Muslim world, but so it goes, I guess.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I think the author if this Atlantic piece did a pretty good job explaining major tenets of Islam. I was glad to see he differentiated (with some help from Haykel) between Islam and Muslims.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As he mentioned, the slow and protracted decline of ISIS is most likely what will happen, but what I’m interested in is what a future Islamic state looks like. Saudi has lost favor as the one true Islamic nation. Iran doesn’t get counted because is Shia. But I’m curious if there will be a future state that’ll be the Muslim equivalent of Israel. Israel was founded on very similar grounds. Zionism espouses some of the same tenets as al-Baghdadi’s Salafism. But Zionism, at least in its most severe form, turned out to be untenable (politically, economically, etc) for Israel, so they went down a more moderate road. [^1] Certainly they had the US’s backing, which helped them survive. I wonder if ISIS will find some sort of moderate version of itself too.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One thing that I thought was missing from this article was a sense of scale. In fact, that’s something I’ve had a hard time grasping anywhere. I don’t know if we’re talking about 500K citizens, a million, 10M? Talking to some strong advocates can have the unintended effect of making the movement seem a lot bigger in scale than it is. But again, I know they control a huge &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/06/12/world/middleeast/the-iraq-isis-conflict-in-maps-photos-and-video.html?_r=0&amp;amp;pagewanted=all&quot;&gt;swathe&lt;/a&gt; of territory between Syria and Iraq but I don’t know how many people we’re talking about. Part of me thinks that there’s some natural ceiling that they’ll hit, after which they’ll have to start becoming more moderate. Because creating social services, a viable economy, etc for a group of thousands is very different than doing that for hundreds of thousands.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dave Chappelle had a really funny joke about ISIS/radical Islam on Monday night when I saw him. He was like “ISIS is like the Tupac of religions. It’s like “YO WHAT, I GO SO HARD MOTHERF**. COME AT ME.” It’s hard to convey over email, but he captured the sentiment really well. And like Tupac, at least younger Tupac, that level of bravado is something that goes away with age. Maybe ISIS will mature out of this stage. Unfortunately their “immaturity” manifests in severed heads, slaves, beaten women, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The author’s description of his conversations with the English and Australian extremists was really interesting. When people betray a strong confidence, have an answer to everything and can convince you, I find that really fascinating. I’m not that confident about anything in my life. I almost envy it. They’ve bought into it wholesale. Muslim communities in the US and elsewhere are having a hard time counteracting online recruitment of young men and women. It’s hard to come back to “we have a strong and principled view about everything” with “well, things are complicated.” It’s not as convincing an argument.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[^1]: that’s probably one of the only times you’ll hear me describe Israel as moderate.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Some thoughts on newsroom analytics</title>
   <link href="/2015/01/27/some-thoughts-on-newsroom-analytics/"/>
   <updated>2015-01-27T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>/2015/01/27/some-thoughts-on-newsroom-analytics</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I recently left my job at &lt;a href=&quot;www.etsy.com&quot;&gt;Etsy&lt;/a&gt; as a data analyst to join the newsroom at the &lt;a href=&quot;www.nytimes.com&quot;&gt;New York Times&lt;/a&gt;. In addition to being sad to leave Etsy, and learning &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt; in my 2 years there, I&amp;#39;m very excited to work with talented journalists and technologists at the Times to help usher the organization into a new era. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve only made it to day-2 but I thought I&amp;#39;d take a moment to write down some thoughts about starting on this new endeavor. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Innovation Report and audience development&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The team I am joining, Audience Development, was born out of the leaked, and much discussed, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scribd.com/doc/224608514/The-Full-New-York-Times-Innovation-Report&quot;&gt;innovation report&lt;/a&gt;. Taking a hard look at the competitive news industry, the NYT decided to set some difficult goals and make some changes. The business side (subscription, ads, finance) of the organization has long used experiments, data analysis and similar empirical tools to make decisions. The newsroom is working on building up the same competencies for news decisions. Analytics, as it happens, is one of these competencies. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Among the many things I have to learn&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What the NYTimes is about and how to think critically about the news consumer. I was able to advocate for the Etsy user pretty well after my 2 years there; thanks in large part to many experiments, user research and tons of data analysis. I would like to learn about and advocate for the NYT news reader in the same way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How does the NYTimes plan on carrying its success in high quality journalism over to the digital age. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because I joined the analyst team at Etsy near its beginning, I was helped with a wide variety of projects and products. I think I have a similar opportunity in joining the newsroom analytics team at its beginning at the Times. I&amp;#39;m eager to see what parts of the newsroom could benefit from studying user behavior in making their work better. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Web experiments have had a &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.okcupid.com/index.php/we-experiment-on-human-beings/&quot;&gt;controversial&lt;/a&gt; year, but I still believe they&amp;#39;re the best way to assess causality. Finding a smart and appropriate way to bring experiments into the newsroom will be a challenge. At the onset, though, I believe there&amp;#39;s a place for it in the newsroom and it can be done successfully. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Etsy, we were pretty lucky to have clear metrics of success. The more sales we could generate for our sellers, the better. A similar &amp;quot;north star&amp;quot; metric is harder to point out in news consumption. I&amp;#39;m sure many at the Times and in the industry have thought critically about this, but it doesn&amp;#39;t seem obvious to me yet. In fact, I think the lack of a clear metric of success is often what derails analytics projects. I&amp;#39;d like to avoid getting derailed by the wrong metrics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Onward!&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m excited to take on this challenge. I&amp;#39;m passionate about seeing the NYTimes survive into the digital age. I&amp;#39;m convinced that the type of journalistic expertise the Times has developed over its 150 year history deserves an audience in our new media landscape. And I&amp;#39;m thankful to have learned what I learned in the last 2 years to help me get started.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>A few words about my experience at MAPSS, UChicago</title>
   <link href="/grad%20school/2014/07/29/a-few-words-about-my-experience-at-mapss-uchicago/"/>
   <updated>2014-07-29T08:24:48-04:00</updated>
   <id>/grad%20school/2014/07/29/a-few-words-about-my-experience-at-mapss-uchicago</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Someone approached me &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Talmudist/status/492464737351790592&quot;&gt;on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; a few days ago with some questions about &lt;a href=&quot;http://mapss.uchicago.edu/&quot;&gt;MAPSS&lt;/a&gt;. We had a short email exchange recently that I thought I&#39;d share on here in case other incoming MAPSS students are interested in learning about my experience there. This is, obviously, just one anecdote about what MAPSS is like, but hopefully readers can gather some insights to inform their decisions or expectations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hi [redacted], &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Happy to help answer questions. I&#39;ll take them in turn, below.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Firstly, regarding cost: I totally agree with you. It&#39;s an, almost prohibitively, expensive program. I was very naive at the time of application and didn&#39;t really consider that too much. Now I&#39;m glad I went forward with it because my life wouldn&#39;t be the same without the training I received at MAPSS. But if I were faced with the same decision again, and I soberly assessed my probabilities of success, I don&#39;t know if I could make the same call as a rational man. I&#39;m glad I got lucky and fell at the tail end of that probability of success and can now afford to pay my student loans :-).&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gmail_extra&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gmail_quote&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;im&quot;&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;gmail_quote&quot;&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;1. If you don&#39;t mind being frank, when and why did you decide not to pursue a PhD? &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; I took a couple of the first year PhD courses along with the first year PhD students who were starting in poli sci. It was clear to me right away that these students were better theorists, writers, thinkers than me. They came to MAPSS with better training, had written better undergraduate theses and were way better read than me. I knew I would have to play a lot of catch-up to get to their level, all the while they would be getting even sharper with access to tenured advisors, reading and writing just like I was.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;One of the first year requirements for poli sci PhDs was a course called &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://political-science.uchicago.edu/academics/courses.shtml&quot;&gt;Data Analysis&lt;/a&gt;,&quot; which was basically an intro into empirical reasoning. I found myself really enjoying discussions in that class, and we got a quick taste for statistical data analysis. I also talked a lot with my preceptor at that time about taking methods courses. My preceptor was honest about the positive experiences she had in methods courses and about how she was seeing her colleagues who were methodologists really succeed in the field. Combined with seeing what kinds of papers were making it into top journals, being a middle east studies student and not really finding [redacted] or [redacted] that impressive (&lt;a href=&quot;http://political-science.uchicago.edu/people/faculty/wedeen.shtml&quot;&gt;Lisa Wedeen&lt;/a&gt;, unfortunately, was away that semester) and not really being super enthusiastic about writing about civil war and terrorism (that&#39;s what other ME poli sci people were writing about) - I pivoted to methods work.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;I still ended up writing my thesis about middle east topics, but with more emphasis on statistical methods I used to push forward my argument.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;im&quot;&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;gmail_quote&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;2. Did you have a significant quant background before attending MAPSS? I also come from a Poli Sci/Poli Theory background...I was wondering how abrupt and difficult the transition was to more quant-oriented courses. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;I had no quantitative background before coming in to MAPSS. I, like a lot of people in the social sciences, never considered myself a &quot;math person.&quot; I attended math camp before classes started and realized that I actually was better at remembering and applying concepts from high school than most of my peers. That was a heartening step, and boosted my confidence to take methods courses. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;While taking methods courses I frequented office hours (TA&#39;s and professor&#39;s) often. I also, almost always, completed problem sets as part of a group. I found it really frustrating to run into walls by myself and not know how to move on. But in groups, running into walls seemed less daunting. I&#39;m certain I wouldn&#39;t have been as successful at those problem sets or methods work in general if it wasn&#39;t for classmate, TA and professor support.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;I also found programing in R and Latex to be a fun exercise. It was my first time working with a low level programming language like R and the syntactical sugar of Latex was a fun challenge to work at. A few of my classmates hated coding, so they had a much harder time finishing problem sets and getting the most out of the course.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;im&quot;&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;gmail_quote&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;3. What is your experience of U Chicago&#39;s career services and alumni network? Did you avail yourself of those connections? &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;I tried to use career services often, especially at the beginning of my time at MAPSS. The designated MAPSS career counselor, [redacted], was helpful but quickly directed me toward the larger career center. They basically sent me off to job fairs, and directed me to job sites like Idealist. Partially my own fault for not being more clear, but I never found career services (at UChicago or my undergraduate institution) to be very helpful. I think if you have a clear idea of what you want (&quot;I want to go to law school&quot; or &quot;I want to be a management consultant&quot;), these types of services can be more useful. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Since I graduated, it seems to me that MAPSS has really gone much further in this area. [Redacted] (current MAPSS career counselor) has organized a lot successful programs (including the one where you caught &lt;a href=&quot;http://samarthbhaskar.wordpress.com/2013/05/31/uchicago-mapss-alumni-talk/&quot;&gt;my talk&lt;/a&gt;) and seems to have a much better approach to answering these questions, from what I can gather. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;im&quot;&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;gmail_quote&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;4. What was your time at MAPSS like? Did you involve yourself in extracurriculars at all? Did you socialize a great deal with your MAPSS Cohort?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;My time at MAPSS was very stressful, but overall the best intellectual growth opportunity I could&#39;ve asked for. I lived in Wicker Park, away from campus, which was hugely helpful. An hour commute separating me from the stress and tension of coursework, writing a thesis, intense classroom debate, etc was very necessary. It allowed me to carve a life outside of MAPSS, spend time with people who knew nothing about my graduate work and didn&#39;t care about it and give my brain a break every night for a couple of hours. My peers at MAPSS, who lived in Hyde Park, all hung out with each other, all complained and gossiped about the same coursework, long hours, professors, etc. I think this had deleterious effects on their ability to perform at a high level and keep a clear mind about their goals.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;I sang with the University choir a few nights a week, which was a nice break from course/thesis work as well. I spent many hours in the libraries, like others, but I tried to treat it like a job. I would arrive early in the morning and work as much as possible before, between and after courses, but I would wrap up and go home for dinner. I have some close friends from my MAPSS cohort, although they represent many disciplines beyond poli sci. I mostly spent time with them grabbing a drink after an evening class, or attending workshops together, or seeing a talk on campus. Oddly enough, most of the people I spent many hours in the library with, working on problem sets, I&#39;m not close with anymore. Take that however you will, ha.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;im&quot;&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;gmail_quote&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;5. Do you have any tips or recommendations regarding the MAPSS experience that you would impart to someone beginning the program?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;I think it&#39;s really important to set goals for yourself and keep yourself oriented toward those goals. That&#39;s not to say goals can&#39;t change, or that you need to know what you&#39;re doing on day 1, but 9-12 months is a very short time and UChicago is an immense place. Your intellectual curiosity can last you forever, but that won&#39;t help you figure out what you want to do once the program ends. I was lucky to figure out that I didn&#39;t want to apply to PhD programs after, so I focused on finding employment. I decided that I didn&#39;t want to let my thesis bleed over into the summer, that I wanted to take that time to find a job, so I worked to finish my thesis by March. I wouldn&#39;t have been able to do that if I didn&#39;t know way back in September that that was a goal for me. My preceptor, advisors and peers were able to help keep me on track because I made it clear from the onset that I wanted to meet every deadline and stay on track to finish my thesis by March. I also picked courses accordingly so the work I was doing for those courses could help me advance my thesis. Almost every chapter of my thesis came from papers I wrote for other classes. This was crucial in helping me workshop each part with a different scholar, and not double my work at the end. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Although it&#39;s very important to stay focused on your ultimate goal, you&#39;d be remiss to miss opportunities that UChicago has to offer that are basically only available at UChicago. I saw many amazing speakers, attended lots of great workshops, spent time in office hours with great scholars and got to know a lot of peers. These are things, I believe, you can do without straying from your own goals. They enhance the experience so much more than a 80 or 90 page thesis that shows the sum total of your knowledge about one topic.  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Sorry if I rambled on a bit here, I mostly meant to say everything that was on my mind without filtering too much. I imagine you have lots of ideas about these things yourself, so you can take or leave as much or as little as you&#39;d like from this.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;All the best as you prepare for the busy year ahead! I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll have a great experience!&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

   <title>An unsolicited thought about Soylent</title>
   <link href="/culture%20and%20society/technology/2014/07/22/an-unsolicited-thought-about-soylent/"/>
   <updated>2014-07-22T20:47:19-04:00</updated>
   <id>/culture%20and%20society/technology/2014/07/22/an-unsolicited-thought-about-soylent</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://samarthbhaskar.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/soylent.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-1056 aligncenter&quot; src=&quot;assets/soylent.jpg?w=226&quot; alt=&quot;soylent&quot; width=&quot;226&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ran across a lot of chatter about &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.portraitsincreativity.com/maira-kalman&quot;&gt;Soylent&lt;/a&gt; today, around the internet and with my friends. I&#39;m curious about the stuff, but I think there is something sort of troubling about the very idea too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firstly, I &lt;a href=&quot;http://samarthbhaskar.com/post/my-love-for-culinary-tourism&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;love&lt;/em&gt; food&lt;/a&gt; a lot. So I mostly consider Soylent an affront to my personal and emotional attachment to experiencing food. I mean, I&#39;m mostly joking, but I&#39;m also sort of serious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also understand that Soylent is meant to serve as a supplement for people who find taking time out of their day to prepare, obtain and consume food annoying. The fact that Soylent was created by, is being championed by, and largely funded by the tech community is not coincidence. Tech, in my ways, infantilizes its members. There are many fantasies in tech that culminate with an engineer or coder being some sort of hyper-efficient programmer, only capable of one thing. The fact that major tech companies offer to do your laundry, feed you on site and give you a ride from home to work is not unrelated. There is some ideal at work underneath all of this that when you were young your parents took care of all these needs and now your company (your new parent) can take care of it. It might be a stretch, but a beige, tasteless substance that meets your every nutritional need is not too far from what your mother provides for you after birth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But even all of that isn&#39;t what bothers me about Soylent. What worries me is that Soylent was able to raise nearly &lt;a href=&quot;http://venturebeat.com/2013/06/21/soylent-crowdfunding-campaign-attracts-755k-so-people-can-survive-without-food/&quot;&gt;$1 million on Kickstarter&lt;/a&gt;. What worries me is that the likes of Andreesen Horowitz are &lt;a href=&quot;http://techcrunch.com/2013/10/21/soylent/&quot;&gt;investing money&lt;/a&gt; in it. I think this is what takes Soylent from some project to work around a human&#39;s need for food or aesthetic pleasure in experiencing food, to something that becomes a commodity for investment. I don&#39;t think Andreesen Horowitz look at a product like this and glance over its potential application as a complete replacement for food not just for engineers but everyone. I can see a future when governments&#39; with food aid programs look to Soylent as some sort of solution to hunger and malnutrition crises. It&#39;s not hard to imagine a rationale that flows something like -- &quot;well people are dying of hunger around the world, give them Soylent, *claps dusty hands*, my job here is done.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that&#39;s not what solving the problem of malnutrition is about. It&#39;s not that &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malthusian_catastrophe#Criticism&quot;&gt;we don&#39;t have enough food&lt;/a&gt; to feed the world&#39;s hungry, it&#39;s that we&#39;re really bad at distributing food equitably. Even if we see a problem like malnutrition or starvation being solved by something like Soylent - then what? What will these people, who have been saved from the edge of starvation do? Will they have access to education? Will they be given a chance to find a job that pays enough of a salary to survive? Will they have the opportunity to find housing in a place of their choosing? What favor have we done them by keeping them alive with Soylent? More likely, will we walk away feeling like we&#39;ve done our job by giving them Soylent so their basal nutritional needs are met while we could care less about needs that come after that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have no intention of painting this picture as the actual or even presumed intentions of the inventors of Soylent. I don&#39;t think they or their investors see this as the problem they&#39;re solving. I don&#39;t have a hard time believing that the inventors of Soylent, their investors and all who are enthusiastic about the product genuinely believe it will be something office workers use as a substitute to walking out and getting an fat laden sandwich for lunch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I do believe, as &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/The-Technological-Society-Jacques-Ellul/dp/0394703901/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1406082811&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;keywords=jacques+ellul&quot;&gt;Jacques Ellul&lt;/a&gt; believed, that technological progress is irreversible. With the exception of the nuclear weapon, society has never reversed the forward movement of technology. So to go blindly on the path of innovation, to try and disrupt everything, to invent for the sake of invention carries with it another responsibility. I think it is the responsibility of the inventor, of the investor, of the problem solver to consider his/her innovation in a broader social context. And I think this is what ultimately bothers me about Soylent. There is a lack of imagination on the part of the inventors to consider what the idea of &lt;em&gt;food replacement&lt;/em&gt; actually means. Food is a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_studies&quot;&gt;huge part of culture&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgflip.com/i/aj0ba&quot;&gt;Once cannot simply&lt;/a&gt; replace its nutritional functions and walk away scot free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Addendum: my friend &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mikearpaia/status/491875612454178816&quot;&gt;Mike asked on twitter&lt;/a&gt;, &quot;should one not solve problems when they exist?&quot; I think this is an apt question and worth an answer longer than 140 characters. In my head, this is how I think about the problem. Say you have both a terrible headache and a brain tumor. The two are likely related. For someone to come in and help you with your headache, maybe even make it go away, is not the same thing as solving the problem. You still have a brain tumor to deal with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This, crude, analogy is how I think about this larger problem of inequality in the world. Alleviating malnutrition is only part of the problem. It is certainly beyond the scope of Soylent, or any one project, to address global inequality. But my point is that thinking you&#39;re helping by fix the headache, when in fact you probably actually caused the brain tumor, isn&#39;t solving the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lest I seem to sure of myself, let me clarify that I have no idea what the right answer is. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s bad that people are trying to solve world hunger, but I do think it is bad that it often stops here.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Why I meditate and participate in endurance sports</title>
   <link href="/life/2014/06/09/why-i-meditate-and-participate-in-endurance-sports/"/>
   <updated>2014-06-09T19:03:33-04:00</updated>
   <id>/life/2014/06/09/why-i-meditate-and-participate-in-endurance-sports</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I ran my first triathlon of the season this past weekend. It was a really fun experience with new friends I&#39;ve made here in Brooklyn. I&#39;ve also been meditating with coworkers and on my own, regularly, for the last 10 plus months. I find a lot in common between these experiences. And I find them instructive for dealing with anxiety about the future, of which there is plenty among my peer group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Endurance sports like distance running, biking, swimming require a lot of mental fortitude. Completing an endurance event is as much a test of mental strength and will power as physical ability. Starting out on mile 1 of a 60 mile bike ride, or turning the corner for mile 20 of a marathon, it is easy to think about what I&#39;ll feel like when I&#39;m done. It&#39;s easy to count backward from the finish line and just convince myself that I&#39;ll keep enduring the pain until it&#39;s over. I sometimes even think the finish line will be worth it, that how crappy I feel in the moment will be rewarded in turn when I finish. But I think that&#39;s a mistake. I find it is much more rewarding to be present. I find much more satisfaction in focusing on how I feel right now. The ride, run or swim become much more calming when I can just focus on how I feel in the moment, enjoying the scenery, focusing on my breath or appreciating the pace I&#39;m keeping up. If I start playing the mental game of &quot;I only have 10 miles to go, which is 5 miles, repeated twice, which is about 30 or 35 minutes, so I should be...&quot; I know I won&#39;t enjoy myself as much. This falsely gives all the credit to the finish, when in fact the finish is only a small fraction of the activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve had similar experiences with meditation. When I first started meditating, I remember having a hard time focusing on the present. My self talk during meditation sessions would primarily be about how I might feel at the end. There was no focus on being present, on learning about the moment I was in. It took me a long time and a lot of practice to understand how to focus on my breath, on how to recognize but not fixate on fleeting thoughts. It was a difficult habit to build, but something I&#39;m glad I worked on. I still work on these habits every time I meditate, but I now understand the goal of focusing on my breath, on allowing myself to learn about my thought patterns and my proclivities through each meditation session.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have found these habits to be very helpful in alleviating anxiety in my day to day life as well. Focusing on the future, thinking about next steps, evaluating experiences in terms of future rewards can be very anxiety provoking. I have talked with peers about these feelings too, and I imagine anxiety about the future is prevalent among many people. I have tried my best to focus on the present when moments like this arise for me. Taking pleasure in the moment you&#39;re in, addressing facts and feelings as you know them now, trying your best not to count backward from some imagined future can go a long way in decreasing some of the anxiety caused by a hyper competitive, status minded, fatigue lauding world. There are a lot of things to be said about why we live in a world like this (from perspectives found in economics, sociology, psychology, philosophy, so on and so on), but that&#39;s a discussion about causes. I have found that in the mean time, this tactic of focusing on the present, can be helpful in treating at least this symptom.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Douglas Hofstadter's unrelenting quest to replicate the human mind</title>

   <id>/commentary%20on%20works/social%20science/technology/2013/11/03/douglas-hofstadters-unrelenting-quest-to-replicate-the-human-mind</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;Douglas Hofstadter&#39;s unrelenting quest to replicate the human mind&quot; href=&quot;http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/print/2013/11/the-man-who-would-teach-machines-to-think/309529/?src=longreads&quot;&gt;Douglas Hofstadter&#39;s unrelenting quest to replicate the human mind&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was first introduced to Douglas Hofstadter by my friend Ashok who is a student of the history of science. Over dinner one night he told me that I should read &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/G%C3%B6del-Escher-Bach-Eternal-Golden/dp/0465026567/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1383523589&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;keywords=godel+escher+bach&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Godel, Escher and Bach&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. I was in a period of devouring anything and everything that was recommended to me and after whetting my appetite with some journal articles and &lt;a href=&quot;http://ssp11si.stanford.edu/geb-syllabus.pdf&quot;&gt;course syllabi&lt;/a&gt;, I dove right in. The experience I had reading GEB was very formative (others include &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/The-Technological-Society-Jacques-Ellul/dp/0394703901/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1383523953&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;keywords=ellul+technological+society&quot;&gt;Technological Society&lt;/a&gt; by Jacques Ellul and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/The-Railway-Journey-Industrialization-Century/dp/0520059298/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1383524091&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;keywords=wolfgang+schivelbusch&quot;&gt;The Railway Journey&lt;/a&gt; by Wolfgang Schivelbusch) in my relationship to scientific thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GEB was one of the first times that I was formally introduced to neuroscience and artificial intelligence. It was one of the first times I felt like I had a low barrier of entry into mathematics and science, fields from which I had long felt estranged. All of this is a testament to Hofstadter&#39;s writing and ultimately the core idea in his book. Hofstadter sets out to make a case that intelligence and consciousness are made from the seemingly disparate building blocks of cognition. He uses math, visual art, music, puzzles and fictional narrative to demonstrate some universalities in intelligence and consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So when I came across a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/print/2013/11/the-man-who-would-teach-machines-to-think/309529/?src=longreads&quot;&gt;piece about Hofstadter&lt;/a&gt; in the Atlantic earlier this week, my interest was piqued. I haven&#39;t really heard or read much about him since GEB and I&#39;ve always been curious why such a great contribution has had so little follow up. And this piece in the Atlantic makes it very clear why this is the case: Hofstadter has no interest in advancing artificial intelligence as a field in the direction it is headed in now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To boil a long piece down to its basic idea, Hofstadter stands at one end of AI research where he and his research group are not interested in imitating how the mind works, but in understanding how the mind works. They&#39;re not happy with replicating some cognitive process with a computer and calling it a victory. On the other end of the spectrum are people like Peter Norvig and Stuart Russell who are interested in outsourcing cognitive processes to AI with no real concern for replicating exactly how that process may or may not happen in the human brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Appetite: re-whetted.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Etsy Ignite: The Importance of Interdisciplinary Thinking</title>

&lt;p&gt;On October 16, 2013 I participated in an Ignite event at Etsy. 12 of my colleagues and I got 5 minutes, 20 auto-advancing slides and the attention of a room-full of our friends and colleagues to tell a story. I talked about why I think it&#39;s important to spend time getting outside of your domain of expertise and learning new things, from the arts for example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really enjoyed putting words and order to my thoughts on this subject. If you&#39;ve followed my Twitter feed at any point in time, you can tell me affinity for all different domains of knowledge. Here&#39;s to more years of consumption, production, exploration and expansion.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>PETER NORVIG RESPONDS TO CHOMSKY</title>
   <link href="/commentary%20on%20works/data%20science/social%20science/technology/2013/10/13/peter-norvig-responds-to-chomsky/"/>
   <updated>2013-10-13T20:52:08-04:00</updated>
   <id>/commentary%20on%20works/data%20science/social%20science/technology/2013/10/13/peter-norvig-responds-to-chomsky</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://samarthbhaskar.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/screen-shot-2013-10-13-at-10-48-45-pm1.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot; wp-image aligncenter&quot; id=&quot;i-1005&quot; alt=&quot;Image&quot; src=&quot;assets/screen-shot-2013-10-13-at-10-48-45-pm1.png?w=650&quot; width=&quot;585&quot; height=&quot;413&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peter Norvig in a response to Noam Chomsky, wrote a &lt;a href=&quot;http://norvig.com/chomsky.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;lengthy essay&lt;/a&gt; on his blog. In it he described and engaged with Chomsky&#39;s claim that &quot;researchers in machine learning who use purely statistical methods to produce behavior that mimics something in the world, but who don&#39;t try to understand the meaning of that behavior.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In so doing, Norvig provided some great examples of statistical models can and cannot do. Before he approached the ultimate question, &quot;are models that try to approximate meaning in language using statistics useful?&quot;, he set up a pretty great explanation of the ways in which statistical models are used. Some key passages are below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While talking about the inferential power of statistical models, Norvig took the example of the ideal gas law (&lt;em&gt;P = N k T / V&lt;/em&gt;). About this model Norvig says&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;This model ignores that complexity and summarizes our uncertainty about the location of individual molecules. Thus, even though it is statistical and probabilistic, even though it does not completely model reality, it does provide both good predictions and insight—insight that is not available from trying to understand the true movements of individual molecules. I think this is a great way to separate what models can and cannot do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later, Norvig makes an engineering, or performance based, case for statistical linguistic models instead of logical ones, which I thought was interesting but somewhat missed the point of what Chomsky&#39;s original complaint was. None the less, he finishes out the blog post by approaching the scientific premise upon which Chomsky built his argument and engaging with that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Norvig suggests that Chomsky&#39;s argument or theory is categorical, and cannot account for gradience like a statistical model can. Even a naive Markov-chain model can be graded according to the probability or extreme-improbability of a sentence or phrase occurring. This gives far more power for insight than the type of logical model that Chomsky might embrace. Norvig says &quot;Chomsky&#39;s theory, being categorical, cannot make this distinction; all it can distinguish is grammatical/ungrammatical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final portion of this article is the most interesting to me. In it, Norvig describes and gives some of his thoughts on the two cultures of modeling: data modeling and algorithmic modeling. The section is too long to quote here, but I highly recommend it.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>'I've Got Nothing to Hide' and Other Misunderstandings of Privacy</title>
   <link href="/2013/10/07/ive-got-nothing-to-hide-and-other-misunderstandings-of-privacy/"/>
   <updated>2013-10-07T19:07:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>/2013/10/07/ive-got-nothing-to-hide-and-other-misunderstandings-of-privacy</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://samarthbhaskar.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/nsa-logo.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image aligncenter&quot; id=&quot;i-982&quot; alt=&quot;Image&quot; src=&quot;assets/nsa-logo.jpg?w=650&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just came across this paper on SSRN, titled&lt;a href=&quot;http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=998565&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt; &#39;I&#39;ve got Nothing to Hide&#39; and other Misunderstandings of Privacy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. It&#39;s a short essay from 2007-2008 that succinctly situates one part of the privacy discussion. More than anything else, I was drawn toward reading it because it directly addresses an argument I found myself making a lot in the last few months regarding the NSA, Prizm, and other government data collection efforts that made national news.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some key take aways from the paper that made me change my mind about making the &quot;I don&#39;t have anything to hide&quot; argument are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&quot;Far too often, discussions of the NSA surveillance and data mining define the problem solely in terms of surveillance. To return to my discussion of metaphor, the problems are not just Orwellian, but Kafkaesque. The NSA programs are problematic even if no information people want to hide is uncovered. In &lt;i&gt;The Trial&lt;/i&gt;, the problem is not inhibited behavior, but rather a suffocating powerlessness and vulnerability created by the court system’s use of personal data and its exclusion of the protagonist from having any knowledge or participation in the process.&quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&quot;[The privacy issue] is not about whether the information gathered is something people want to hide, but rather about the power and the structure of government.&quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&quot;One of the difficulties with the nothing to hide argument is that it looks for a visceral kind of injury as opposed to a structural one. &quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My proclivities as a millennial, whose political world view was largely formed by September 11th, led me astray on this matter it seems. I found myself erring on the side of &quot;well my personal discomfort, if any, will most likely be relegated to embarrassment at worst, and in exchange for increased national security, maybe it&#39;s a worthwhile trade.&quot; (or some bastardized version of that argument) But having someone lay the entire privacy question out, define privacy (a difficult endeavor in itself) and address the fact that saying &quot;I have nothing to hide,&quot; almost entirely misses the point was beneficial. &lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fbigi6BFDJ0&amp;amp;feature=player_embedded&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In March of this year I was invited back by my graduate program, &lt;a href=&quot;http://mapss.uchicago.edu/&quot;&gt;MAPSS&lt;/a&gt;, at the University of Chicago to give a short talk and sit on student panels about career development. The event ended up being a really great way to tie together some of the disparate pieces of my career trajectory thus far. I enjoyed giving the talk and especially talking to all the students I met afterward about their varied interests, my interests and all the ways in which we hope to contribute to the world, academically and professionally after obtaining our masters degrees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&#39;s the talk I gave about my, albeit short, career so far. What I&#39;ve learned, how I got here and what I urged students to think about. As I mention at the beginning of the talk, these are things I&#39;m still thinking about and figuring out for myself, so this talk was less prescriptive and more an opener to a conversation with students who are also thinking and figuring these things out for themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Addendum: I wrote a longer post about my experience at MAPSS, you can find that &lt;a href=&quot;http://samarthbhaskar.wordpress.com/2014/07/29/a-few-words-about-my-experience-at-mapss-uchicago/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>H.L. Mencken and Pixar's RATATOUILLE on criticism</title>
   <link href="/commentary%20on%20works/culture%20and%20society/movies/2013/01/27/h-l-mencken-and-pixars-ratatouille-on-criticism/"/>
   <updated>2013-01-27T10:56:01-05:00</updated>
   <id>/commentary%20on%20works/culture%20and%20society/movies/2013/01/27/h-l-mencken-and-pixars-ratatouille-on-criticism</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I remember after I saw &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0382932/&quot;&gt;Ratatouille&lt;/a&gt; in 2007, I was thinking a lot about criticism and the role of critics in the art landscape. Without spoiling much, a pivotal character in the film is Anton Ego, the food critic who is known to be impressed by nothing but holds Parisian attention hostage on the matter of the best food in Paris. Ego (a moniker that deserves consideration in itself; Is he consumed by his own conception of himself? Were the writers commenting perhaps on Freudian concept of the ego, or maybe even Lacanian concepts? Who knows) is vilified throughout the entire film but ends up being the final release we get as an audience, when he falls in love with our chefs Remi and Linguini&#39;s cooking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the time of viewing, I remember thinking - what in the world gave Ego (or critics at large) such power that he gets to decide what is or isn&#39;t good art? Why isn&#39;t art democratic? What about the hundreds of people who love the art that Remy and Linguini (or artists) create? Since then I&#39;ve had a number of conversations with friends about the role of criticism in society. And I&#39;ve even had periods where I&#39;ll only read a particular film or literature critic, or swear off of criticism all together, or some combination in between.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, I ran across &lt;a href=&quot;http://vserver1.cscs.lsa.umich.edu/~crshalizi/Mencken/criticism-of-criticism-of-criticism/&quot;&gt;this essay by H.L. Mencken&lt;/a&gt; (who, in interest of full disclosure, I was first introduced to because of the ending quote on the last episode of THE WIRE). In it, he introduces a pretty compelling definition of and case for criticism. This snippet summed it up well for me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;address&gt;It is [the critic&#39;s] business to provoke the reaction between the work of art and the spectator. The spectator, untutored, stands unmoved; he sees the work of art, but it fails to make any intelligible impression on him; if he were spontaneously sensitive to it, there would be no need for criticism. But now comes the critic with his catalysis. He makes the work of art live for the spectator; he makes the spectator live for the work of art. Out of the process comes understanding, appreciation, intelligent enjoyment --- and that is precisely what the artist tried to produce.&lt;/address&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&#39;t know if I&#39;ve come across too many such critics, at least in the areas of art that I access all the time (books, films, music). However, when I do come across such critical works, they become very meaningful very quickly. I don&#39;t know if Ego in Ratatouille ever gave us this, but perhaps the sequence of him remembering his childhood and his mother&#39;s cooking was the closest we got.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the controversy surrounding the Allen Ginsburg poem &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.poets.org/viewmedia.php/prmMID/15308&quot;&gt;Howl&lt;/a&gt;&quot;, one critic on the witness stand when asked about the meaning of specific words or sentences in the poem said something like &quot;well, that&#39;s why poetry is poetry. It&#39;s not prose. It can&#39;t easily be explained in prose.&quot; I think that&#39;s what a good critic can sometimes do. S/he can turn poetry into prose.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;blockquote&gt;Scientists — even the hardest of scientists — fabricate data, fabricate studies, fall prey to fads, and otherwise get things wrong. But more relevantly, they just don’t know that much. We have very little idea of how the body works; the pills we take are made through the bluntest of means. We don’t know how to calculate very simple things, like the dispersion of milk in a cup of coffee. The illusion that social science is ineffective can only be sustained by ignorance of such ineffectiveness of hard science. The upside of all this is that there is hope for social science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many people have written and spoken much more poignant words about Aaron Swartz&#39;s passing over the weekend. I never knew him, and was only familiar with his work in passing. But, for good reason, I found myself reading a lot about him over the weekend and I found this &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/socialscience&quot;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; from 2005 on his website particularly compelling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For such a short piece about the nature and state of the social sciences, Swartz really packed a punch. These are thoughts that I&#39;ve thought and talked about many times before, but this piece is a great articulation of them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an effort to not mystify Aaron&#39;s work and contributions, I find this sort of thing to be something I can do to help. I can look through his body of work, look up to his example and do my best to find my calling in the quest to bring the social sciences, and specifically the empirical social sciences, to serve society. Rest in piece Aaron. &lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Junot Diaz - as impactful when he speaks as when he writes</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2VznOkJUJY&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Junot Diaz, author of the highly acclaimed &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Drown-Junot-Diaz/dp/1573226068/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1355470859&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;keywords=drown&quot;&gt;Drown&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Brief-Wondrous-Life-Oscar-Wao/dp/1594483299/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1355470911&amp;amp;sr=1-1&amp;amp;keywords=brief+wondrous+life+of+oscar+wao&quot;&gt;The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao&lt;/a&gt; and the recently released &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/This-How-You-Lose-Her/dp/1594487367/ref=sr_1_7?s=books&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1355470911&amp;amp;sr=1-7&amp;amp;keywords=brief+wondrous+life+of+oscar+wao&quot;&gt;This is How You Lose Her&lt;/a&gt;, is amazingly eloquent as a speaker. He carries over his intelligence, charm, wit, humor, empathy and insight from the page to the interview set quite seamlessly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have watched a handful of really interesting interviews with Diaz discussing his experiences as a writer, an academic, a cultural critic and all the various roles he has taken on in his life. A common thread between all of the clips is his ability to construct a thought with precision and insight that is emblematic of a highly matured thought process. He hardly fails, even in sentences that seem to be off-the-cuff or filler, to convey a cogent and considered thought. After spending a year surrounded by mainstream political rhetoric, which even at its finest can be less than evocative and often repeats familiar patterns, I am perhaps more impressed than an average viewer with Diaz&#39;s oratory. It also doesn&#39;t hurt that I&#39;ve devoured his writing in the last few years and thought highly of him as a cultural icon for hyphenated-Americans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None the less, I hope to learn from him. Learn to speak as deeply as I think. Maybe I should start by thinking deeply first.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Causality in Political Networks</title>
   <link href="/books/data%20science/2012/11/24/rajaraman-and-ullmans-mining-of-massive-datasets/"/>
   <updated>2012-11-24T13:35:52-05:00</updated>
   <id>/books/data%20science/2012/11/24/rajaraman-and-ullmans-mining-of-massive-datasets</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A 2011 paper in &lt;em&gt;American Politics Research&lt;/em&gt; titled &quot;Causality in Political Networks&quot; discusses some important concerns about assigning causality to social network analysis studies, especially when it comes to political behavior and preferences. The basic definition of causality adopted by the authors is one put forward by Henry Brady in 2008 that basically says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;causal arguments are stronger to the extent that they demonstrate  our elements: (a) “constant conjunction of causes and effects”; (b)  No effect when the cause is absent in the most similar world to where the cause is present”; (c) “An effect after a cause is manipulated”; and (d)  The identification of “Activities and processes [i.e., mechanisms] linking causes and effects” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors then go on to discuss, in five short essays, how causality may be assessed through social network analysis. From survey data, field experiments, socio-centric data to measurement errors and study-design, this paper is a pretty good place to start when thinking about how you can move past descriptive analysis to something closer to causal inference in social network analysis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the sake of disclosure: one of the authors of this paper is my former graduate advisor. Another was a professor during graduate school.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drew Conway (hacker, data-scientist, political-scientist, and pseudo-data-celebrity) gave this great talk recently at a conference that I enjoyed. He talks about the intersection of the data-sciences (hacking + statistics) and the social sciences. Drew, whose book &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Machine-Learning-Hackers-Drew-Conway/dp/1449303714&quot;&gt;Machine Learning for Hackers&lt;/a&gt;, I enjoyed a lot is a great example of someone who is bringing the tools of computer science and data-science to bear on an unrelated (at first glance) field, the social sciences.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>David Foster Wallace on Kafka's Humor</title>

   <id>/books/commentary%20on%20works/culture%20and%20society/2011/10/12/david-foster-wallace-on-kafkas-humor</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Consider the Lobster &lt;/em&gt;David Foster Wallace has a short essay titled &quot;Some Remarks on Kafka&#39;s Funniness From Which Probably Not Enough Has Been Removed,&quot; in which he presents his case for reading humor in Kafka and how he tried to teach his students to do this when teaching Kafka. I liked this passage at the end and wanted to share it&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s not that students don&#39;t &quot;get&quot; Kafka&#39;s humor but that we&#39;ve taught them to see humor as something you &lt;em&gt;get&lt;/em&gt; - the same way we&#39;ve taught them that a self is something you just &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt;. No wonder they cannot appreciate the really center Kafka joke: that the horrific struggle to establish a human self results in a self whose humanity is inseparable from that horrific struggle. That our endless and impossible journey toward home is in fact our home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rest of the essays in the collection are great too. Some personal favorites include &quot;How Tracy Austin Broke My Heart,&quot; &quot;Authority and American Usage,&quot; and &quot;Certainly the End of &lt;em&gt;Something&lt;/em&gt; or Other, One Would Sort of Have to Think.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Bayesian methods in applied econometrics</title>

   <updated>2011-10-11T13:36:31-04:00</updated>
   <id>/commentary%20on%20works/economics/social%20science/talks/2011/10/11/bayesian-methods-in-applied-econometrics</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Christopher Simms, of recent &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-10-10/sargent-sims-share-2011-nobel-in-economics.html&quot;&gt;Nobel fame&lt;/a&gt;, has a&lt;a href=&quot;http://sims.princeton.edu/yftp/EmetSoc607/AppliedBayes.pdf&quot;&gt; presentation&lt;/a&gt; [pdf] up on his website from 2007 that is a pretty good introduction to the difference between frequentist and Bayesian approaches to economics, and ultimately why a Bayesian approach is most prudent for economists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This from his introduction sets up the basic premises of his presentation -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Introduction&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The ﬁrst part of the talk makes some unoriginal claims about the role of Bayesian thinking.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Despite being unoriginal, and obvious to me and to a minority of econometricians, they are unfamiliar, thought-provoking, or outrageous to quite a few econometricians.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A summer seminar talk seems a good place to restate claims that are both obvious and outrageous and that therefore (for one of these reasons or the other) are usually excluded from journal articles.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The latter part of the talk discusses some areas of econometric application where frequentist asymptotics seems particularly persistent and suggests how Bayesian approaches might become more practical and prevalent.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Although I&#39;m not entirely comfortable with Bayesian statistics, this was an interesting presentation to read none the less. I plan on referring back to this in the future when I come across some decisions about methodology for research projects.&lt;/div&gt;

   <title>Blogging as a bridge between academia and public sphere</title>

   <id>/commentary%20on%20works/economics/international%20relations/social%20science/2011/09/02/blogging-as-a-bridge-between-academia-and-public-sphere</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Harvard political scientist Stephen Walt &lt;a href=&quot;http://publicsphere.ssrc.org/walt-international-affairs-and-the-public-sphere/&quot;&gt;wrote an essay&lt;/a&gt; on the role of international affairs academics in the public sphere. Not the first of its kind of course, but this essay is a pretty thorough description of the state of the two arenas (academia and policy/public sphere) and how they do not co-exist nearly as much as they should. Walt is speaking as an international relations scholar, but his complaints and recommendations could probably span across academic disciplines (perhaps with the exception of the natural sciences, since people don&#39;t have as many intuitions about how quantum mechanics or gene therapy works on which to  base their biases).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The essay is worth a read, if for no other reason, to get an idea of the relationship between the academy and the public sphere over the course of modern history. Among the many suggestions Walt outlines to remedy this broken relationship, he suggests that popular writing (op-eds, articles in newspapers and magazines, blogs, etc) should not be looked down upon within the academy. On the suggestion of blogs, this working paper &lt;a href=&quot;http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/IW3P/IB/2011/08/29/000158349_20110829130036/Rendered/PDF/WPS5783.pdf&quot;&gt;[PDF]&lt;/a&gt; by the World Bank comes to mind. In it, the impact of popular economics blogs is assessed through various experimental and non-experimental means.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The paper offers 3 main take-aways:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Links from blogs cause a striking increase in abstract views or downloads of economics papers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Blogging raises the profile of the blogger (and his or her institution) and boosts their reputation above economists with similar publication records.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Blogs can transform attitudes about some of the topics they cover.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Edit on September 14, 2011 at 4pm (central): Here are two other( &lt;a href=&quot;http://publicsphere.ssrc.org/smith-political-science-and-the-public-sphere/&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://publicsphere.ssrc.org/anderson-international-affairs-political-science-and-the-public-sphere/&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;) papers from &lt;a href=&quot;http://publicsphere.ssrc.org/initiative-academia-public-sphere/&quot;&gt;this conference&lt;/a&gt; where Walt will be presenting the paper above. May be of interest in addition to this Walt paper.&lt;/div&gt;

   <title>Ed Glaeser on the nascent social sciences</title>
   <link href="/commentary%20on%20works/social%20science/2011/09/01/ed-glaeser-on-the-nascent-social-sciences/"/>
   <updated>2011-09-01T15:24:03-04:00</updated>
   <id>/commentary%20on%20works/social%20science/2011/09/01/ed-glaeser-on-the-nascent-social-sciences</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Harvard economist Ed Glaeser writes cogently in this article in Harvard magazine about how nascent the social sciences really are. Formal modeling and reliance on data driven research has only been the case for social scientists for less than a century. In the grand scheme of knowledge production and academic progress, this is not very long at all. Glaeser&#39;s article is worth the short read, but here are some passages worth quoting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;As data quality has improved, social scientists have moved beyond facts and correlations to the deeper quest for causality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good social-science experimental research first proliferated in psychology labs. Economists followed the psychologists by creating labs that tested (and often rejected) the predictions that game theory made concerning behavior in markets and auctions. But there is only so much that laboratory experiments can teach us about the long-term impact of having good neighbors or the functioning of a large, real market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The adoption of experimental methods and improved data quality have, in turn, helped generate the third major social-science trend—the increasing irrelevance of traditional field boundaries. Empirical approaches are far more likely than theoretical edifices to be common across fields.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Social science is changing rapidly, as better data and real experiments replace the worldly philosophy of the past. Yet that change means that nineteenth-century field definitions feel increasingly obsolete.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

   <title>Commanding Heights - PBS Documentary</title>
   <link href="/commentary%20on%20works/economics/international%20relations/movies/politics/2011/08/31/commanding-heights-pbs-documentary/"/>
   <updated>2011-08-31T13:00:45-04:00</updated>
   <id>/commentary%20on%20works/economics/international%20relations/movies/politics/2011/08/31/commanding-heights-pbs-documentary</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Last week I watched all three episodes of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/commandingheights/&quot;&gt;Commanding Heights&lt;/a&gt;, a 2002 PBS documentary based off of a book by Daniel Yergin and Joseph Stanislaw titled &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Commanding-Heights-Government-Marketplace-Remaking/dp/0684829754/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1314815039&amp;amp;sr=8-1&quot;&gt;The Commanding Heights: The Battle Between Government and the Marketplace That Is Remaking the Modern World&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;The documentary was presented in three, 2-h0ur long episodes that discussed the development of the modern global economic system. The subject matter could easily double as a doctoral dissertation or an academic sub-discipline of its own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Episode 1: The Battle of Ideas&lt;/strong&gt; takes an in-depth look at John Maynard Keynes and Friedrich von Hayek as two competing yet highly influential economists post World War I. The episode features depictions of Keynesianism&#39;s rise to prominence in the middle part of the 20th century, the ascendence of communism, the establishment of Chicago-school economists in the US and finally the development of market-oriented policy under Reagan in the US and Thatcher in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Episode 2: The Agony of Reform&lt;/strong&gt; starts out by showing global economic downturns in both Western democratic and communist countries. Mostly working to highlight the failure of centrally planned economies, this episode shows the struggle that many (if not all economies) went through to transition toward privatization and moving away from Keynes toward Hayek. &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shock_therapy_(economics)&quot;&gt;Jeff Sach&#39;s &quot;shock therapy&quot;&lt;/a&gt; is centrally featured, as is the fall of the USSR and the emergence of post-Soviet bloc states.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Episode 3: The New Rules of the Game&lt;/strong&gt; delves into concepts and issues in globalization. Unequal distribution of resources and wealth are highlighted as the episode wanders through the rise and fall of the Asian Tiger economies, troubles in Mexico, concerns of labor unions who felt powerless in the United States and the Clinton administration&#39;s relentless pursuit of unfettered globalization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all, the documentary features interviews from former and current heads of state (Clinton, Thatcher, Goni, bin Mohamad), economic powerhouses (Hayek, Friedman, Sachs) , policy-makers (Rubin, Corzine) and leaders of international organizations - a veritable who&#39;s who of international political economy. If you find yourself with 6 hours to kill and an insatiable appetite for understanding how and why the global economy works as it does today, I highly recommend this documentary. In all honesty, I can&#39;t recommend this documentary highly enough. The in-depth analysis, narrative structure and highly convincing content is a must see for all students of politics, economics or the world at large. It is my contention that just as the tragedy of 9/11 created greater interest in foreign policy, military strategy and comparative politics, the economic and financial crises we&#39;re in today will be responsible for a new generation of students concerned with economic, political and global issues. It&#39;s unfortunate that it takes such tragedies to spark these interests, but with these events so prime in our minds, there is no doubt that young-people like myself will work to understand what went wrong and do our best to avoid repeating these failures in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Incidentally, this has also made me look forward to reading &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Quest-Energy-Security-Remaking-Modern/dp/1594202834/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1314816517&amp;amp;sr=8-1&quot;&gt;Yergin&#39;s newest book&lt;/a&gt; on energy, security and post-9/11 global issues.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>A literature review of the impact of the Internet on the brain</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nominettrust.org.uk/soa-impact-internet-brain&quot;&gt;this report&lt;/a&gt; published by Nominet Trust out of the UK, a neuroscientist compiles the latest research in neuroscience about the impact of the Internet on our brains. As with most academic ventures, no real conclusions are drawn and lots of caveats populate the pages, but this is a well put together compilation of the state of knowledge on the subject. Below are some take aways from the executive summary that I liked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On painting with broad strokes -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rather than label any type of technology as being good or bad for our brain, it is how specific applications are created and used (by who, when and what for) that determine their impact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On offline behavior influencing online behavior -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Existing forms of online communication for supporting existing friendships are generally beneficial for their users, with little basis for considering that social network sites and online communication, in themselves, are a source of special risk to children. Internet-related abuse (eg inappropriate sexual solicitation, cyberbullying) appears related to issues beyond the use of the internet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On learning and the Internet -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The internet is a valuable learning resource and all learning involves changes in the brain. Some technology-based types of training can improve working memory, and others can provide mental stimulation that helps slow cognitive decline&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On sleep -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Evidence linking technology-based activity to a reduction in physical exercise is mixed, but how and when technology is used does appear to influence sleep. In particular, late night technology use is linked to reduction in sleep and sleep quality, and teenagers who use their mobile phones after “lights out” are considerably more likely to suffer daytime sleepiness. Again, games may be different from most other types of&lt;br /&gt;
technology in their influence on neurobiological processes, with some evidence that they can disrupt children’s sleep and learning even when played early in the evening&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:left;&quot;&gt;&quot;In the Indian capital of New Delhi, a tiny cohort of Internet savvy consumers is demanding better services from their government and is using social media to make it happen, even though the vast majority of the town’s residents remain off the Internet&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The end of &lt;a href=&quot;http://sustainablebusinessforum.com/user/51809&quot;&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt; claims some minor successes (mostly relating to public shaming of abuses of power by the Delhi traffic police) but in the quote above, the line &quot;even though the vast majority of the town&#39;s residents remain off the Internet&quot; caught my eye.&lt;br /&gt;
I am not sure exactly what my thoughts are yet, but the difference in what demographic of a political constituency uses a social media tool versus embodied protest might be an interesting way to model social media usage for political purposes. Perhaps educated, networked, drivers in New Delhi are completely well-suited as a demographic who would use social media to air grievances. While uneducated, disenfranchised, impoverished residents might not be the right demographic to try and pose or answer questions about social media usage.&lt;/p&gt;

   <id>/commentary%20on%20works/economics/social%20science/2011/08/24/sex-lies-and-overblown-statistics</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;John Kay writes in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/dfe55458-ccb6-11e0-b923-00144feabdc0.html#axzz1VvhLEcx7&quot;&gt;Financial Times&lt;/a&gt; -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Statistics are only as valid as the sources from which they are drawn and the abilities of those who use them. When I discover something surprising in data, the most common explanation is that I made a mistake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A short and worthwhile read about how to consume statistical information. Among the basic questions to ask yourself and the author are &quot;what is the question to which the number is the answer?&quot;, &quot;where does the data come from?&quot; and &quot;is an unexpected finding a feature of the data or a feature of the world?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Edit (@10:55): &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.johnkay.com/2003/05/15/political-decisions-are-not-a-matter-of-statistics&quot;&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt; on Kay&#39;s website is pretty great too. It&#39;s about political decisions and how they rarely adhere to cost-benefit analyses or statistical evidence. He wrote this in 2003, right around the time the UK was considering adopting the Euro.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Experimental design in the Social Sciences</title>
   <link href="/commentary%20on%20works/economics/social%20science/2011/08/19/experimental-design-in-the-social-sciences/"/>
   <updated>2011-08-19T08:36:49-04:00</updated>
   <id>/commentary%20on%20works/economics/social%20science/2011/08/19/experimental-design-in-the-social-sciences</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.city-journal.org/2010/20_3_social-science.html&quot;&gt;Here&#39;s a pretty cool piece&lt;/a&gt; from the City Journal by Jim Manzi from Summer 2010 talking about causal claims in the social sciences. He has a concise history of experiment design and methodology from the natural and biological sciences that plays well into the kinds of things the social sciences should be worrying about. I have always been wary of modeling the social sciences &lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt; after the natural sciences because there are obviously differences between the two that require attention, but for now, I think the natural science model of inquiry is a good one to aspire to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None the less, Manzi talks about things like randomization:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1884, the brilliant but erratic American polymath C. S. Peirce hit upon a solution when he &lt;em&gt;randomly&lt;/em&gt; assigned participants to the test and control groups. Random assignment permits a medical experimentalist to conclude reliably that differences in outcome are caused by differences in treatment. That’s because even causal differences among individuals of which the experimentalist is unaware—say, that genetic predisposition—should be roughly equally distributed between the test and control groups, and therefore not bias the result.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generalizability, or external validity:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even in classical therapeutic experiments, the assumption of uniform biological response is often a tolerable approximation that permits researchers to assert, say, that the polio vaccine that worked for a test population will also work for human beings beyond the test population. But we cannot safely assume that a literacy program that works in one school will work in all schools. Just as high causal densities in biology created the need for randomization, even higher causal densities in the social sciences create the need for even greater rigor when we try to generalize the results of an experiment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end he has three take-aways that aren&#39;t exhaustive but worth keeping in mind:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, few programs can be shown to work in properly randomized and replicated trials. Despite complex and impressive-sounding empirical arguments by advocates and analysts, we should be very skeptical of claims for the effectiveness of new, counterintuitive programs and policies, and we should be reluctant to trump the trial-and-error process of social evolution in matters of economics or social policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, within this universe of programs that are far more likely to fail than succeed, programs that try to change &lt;em&gt;people&lt;/em&gt; are even more likely to fail than those that try to change &lt;em&gt;incentives&lt;/em&gt;. A litany of program ideas designed to push welfare recipients into the workforce failed when tested in those randomized experiments of the welfare-reform era; only adding mandatory work requirements succeeded in moving people from welfare to work in a humane fashion. And mandatory work-requirement programs that emphasize just getting a job are far more effective than those that emphasize skills-building. Similarly, the list of failed attempts to change people to make them less likely to commit crimes is almost endless—prisoner counseling, transitional aid to prisoners, intensive probation, juvenile boot camps—but the only program concept that tentatively demonstrated reductions in crime rates in replicated RFTs was nuisance abatement, which changes the &lt;em&gt;environment&lt;/em&gt; in which criminals operate. (This isn’t to say that direct behavior-improvement programs can never work; one well-known program that sends nurses to visit new or expectant mothers seems to have succeeded in improving various social outcomes in replicated independent RFTs.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And third, there is no magic. Those rare programs that do work usually lead to improvements that are quite modest, compared with the size of the problems they are meant to address or the dreams of advocates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, in terms of randomized field trials, I would be remiss to not mention &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Poor-Economics-Radical-Rethinking-Poverty/dp/1586487981&quot;&gt;Banerjee and Duflo&#39;s &lt;em&gt;Poor Economics&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, one of the best popular titles I&#39;ve read coming out of economics and development literature. This &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2011/04/25/more_than_1_billion_people_are_hungry_in_the_world?page=full&quot;&gt;Foreign Policy article&lt;/a&gt; is a great introduction if you don&#39;t have time to read the book.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Gary King on future data-richness in the social sciences</title>

   <id>/commentary%20on%20works/social%20science/2011/08/13/gary-king-on-future-data-richness-in-the-social-sciences</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Gary King (Harvard social scientist, statistician and &lt;a href=&quot;http://gking.harvard.edu/amelia/&quot;&gt;R-magician extraordinaire&lt;/a&gt;) published a piece in the journal &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt; earlier this year that provided some philosophical and methodological grounding for the future of data usage for social scientific inference. In it he puts forth the idea that social science is at the cusp of the ability to study human society as never before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analogous to what it must have been like when they first handed out microscopes to microbiologists, social scientists are getting to the point in many areas at which enough information exists to understand and address major previously intractable problems that affect human society.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;King, correctly in my opinion, supports the idea that if privacy is adequately protected we can take advantage of new (sometimes digital, sometimes not) data, facilitate data sharing and replication and gain inferential powers that have hardly been seen in our field. The whole piece is worth reading (much shorter and much more consumable than most academic articles) and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://gking.harvard.edu/files/datarich.pdf&quot;&gt;PDF link is provided here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a tangential note, with the recent controversy over illegal spread and usage of academic articles, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2011/jul/21/aaron-swartz-indicted-hacking-charges&quot;&gt;namely the arrest of Aaron Swartz&lt;/a&gt;, I think one solution might be for researchers to publish their pieces on their personal/professional websites. This might come with some backlash from journals and I&#39;m not exactly sure what the ownership rights over a published piece in a journal are, but most researchers have their own sites these days, and this might serve as a good compromise until we can &lt;a href=&quot;http://thinkprogress.org/yglesias/2011/07/20/273897/academic-work-should-be-distributed-for-free/&quot;&gt;figure out a better solut&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://thinkprogress.org/yglesias/2011/07/20/273897/academic-work-should-be-distributed-for-free/&quot;&gt;ion.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Edit: Here&#39;s a great &lt;a href=&quot;http://techheads.tv/diavlogs/37866&quot;&gt;Techheads.tv with Julian Sanchez and Timothy B. Lee&lt;/a&gt; about the Aaron Swartz controversy, and IP issues at large.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

   <title>Podcast: Darren Acemoglu on inequality and the financial crisis</title>

   <id>/commentary%20on%20works/economics/talks/2011/08/13/podcast-darren-acemoglu-on-inequality-and-the-financial-crisis</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;After reading Darren Acemoglu, MIT economist, in the Harvard Business Review the other day on the topic of &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.hbr.org/cs/2011/08/the_real_solution_is_growth.html&quot;&gt;threats to growth in the United States&lt;/a&gt;, I ran across this &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.econtalk.org/archives/2011/02/acemoglu_on_ine.html&quot;&gt;podcast&lt;/a&gt; with him from earlier this year. In it, he takes on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Fault-Lines-Fractures-Threaten-Economy/dp/0691146837/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1313242436&amp;amp;sr=8-1&quot;&gt;Raghuram Rajan&#39;s main argument &lt;/a&gt;that&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Fault-Lines-Fractures-Threaten-Economy/dp/0691146837/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1313242436&amp;amp;sr=8-1&quot;&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;growing income inequality in the last part of the 20th century created a political demand for redistribution and various policy changes. This in turn created the push for higher home ownership rates and led to the distortions of the housing market that in turn led to excessive risk-taking in the financial market. Acemoglu suggests a simpler story where the financial sector through its political influence distorted the rules of the game, benefiting executives in the industry, which in turn led to outsized rewards and ultimate instability in the financial industry. The conversation discusses ways of distinguishing between these two arguments and what might be done to change the incentives of politicians.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The clarity with which Acemoglu explains his argument is worthy of the hour spent listening to the podcast, in itself. Add to that, the argument that Acemoglu is putting forward and its focus on political institutions rather than consumer behavior is much more in line with some of my concerns regarding the crisis. Well, I should be less sensationalist here. Acemoglu takes on the idea of differentiating between the two (political institutions and consumer behavior) rather than one of the other. None the less, in the never ending stream of punditry and waxing on and on about the financial crisis, I found this to be one of the better hours I spent.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Harvard Business Review has a &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.hbr.org/cs/2011/08/success_comes_from_better_data.html?cm_sp=blog_flyout-_-cs-_-success_comes_from_better_data&quot;&gt;new blog post&lt;/a&gt; up by Daryl Morey, the General Manager of the Houston Rockets, in which he argues that with a market teeming with better and better analysts, its not the skills of these analysts that will be the future of successful quantitative analysis, but instead the quality of data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The answer is better data. Yep, that&#39;s right. Raw numbers, not the people and programs that attempt to make sense of them. Many organizations have spent the last few years hiring top analysts based on the belief that they create differentiation. Smart companies such as Google believe they need savants to crunch those numbers and find the connections that regular humans could not. But my experience, and what I&#39;m hearing from more organizations (sports and non), shows that real advantage comes from unique data that no one else has.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m not so convinced. I think we&#39;re headed toward an age of a&lt;a href=&quot;http://quantifiedself.com/about/&quot;&gt; quantifiable&lt;/a&gt; representation of a majority of our world. So, in some ways, I am on board with Morey&#39;s call for higher quality data. But I believe that will be almost inevitable. What I would like to see is better theory applied to analyze this data, for &lt;a href=&quot;http://data.worldbank.org/&quot;&gt;data to be open&lt;/a&gt; for use and analysis by experts and non-experts alike and for the inferences that are drawn on the data to be put toward actionable results (in my field of interest, toward smarter policy).&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Bayesian statistics in the NYT</title>

   <id>/books/commentary%20on%20works/social%20science/2011/08/08/bayesian-statistics-in-the-nyt</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The NYT has a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/07/books/review/the-theory-that-would-not-die-by-sharon-bertsch-mcgrayne-book-review.html?ref=books&amp;amp;pagewanted=all&quot;&gt;book review&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Theory-That-Would-Not-Die/dp/0300169698/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1312843023&amp;amp;sr=8-1&quot;&gt;THE THEORY THAT WOULD NOT DIE&lt;/a&gt;: How Bayes’ Rule Cracked the Enigma Code, Hunted Down Russian Submarines and Emerged Triumphant From Two Centuries of Controversy, a new book by Sharon Bertsch McGrayne. I have not read the book, but the article is a good introduction to the Bayesian approach to statistical analysis, or at least what it claims to do in theory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The theorem itself can be stated simply. Beginning with a provisional hypothesis about the world (there are, of course, no other kinds), we assign to it an initial probability called the prior probability or simply the prior. After actively collecting or happening upon some potentially relevant evidence, we use Bayes’s theorem to recalculate the probability of the hypothesis in light of the new evidence. This revised probability is called the posterior probability or simply the posterior. Specifically Bayes’s theorem states (trumpets sound here) that the posterior probability of a hypothesis is equal to the product of (a) the prior probability of the hypothesis and (b) the conditional probability of the evidence given the hypothesis, divided by (c) the probability of the new evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider a concrete example. Assume that you’re presented with three coins, two of them fair and the other a counterfeit that always lands heads. If you randomly pick one of the three coins, the probability that it’s the counterfeit is 1 in 3. This is the prior probability of the hypothesis that the coin is counterfeit. Now after picking the coin, you flip it three times and observe that it lands heads each time. Seeing this new evidence that your chosen coin has landed heads three times in a row, you want to know the revised posterior probability that it is the counterfeit. The answer to this question, found using Bayes’s theorem (calculation mercifully omitted), is 4 in 5. You thus revise your probability estimate of the coin’s being counterfeit upward from 1 in 3 to 4 in 5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

4) Produce&lt;br /&gt;
5) Seek Discomfort&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m hoping to bring these skills to bear on future research and job opportunities, so I can advance not only my ability to draw inferences on data (social, political, or otherwise) but also present the data and my inferences more skillfully.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>My 11 favorite ESPN 30 for 30s</title>

   <id>/commentary%20on%20works/culture%20and%20society/tv/2011/07/21/my-11-favorite-espn-30-for-30s</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://samarthbhaskar.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/30for30.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-355&quot; title=&quot;30for30&quot; src=&quot;assets/30for30.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;224&quot; height=&quot;145&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recently finished watching all 30 &lt;a href=&quot;http://30for30.espn.com/&quot;&gt;ESPN 30 for 30s&lt;/a&gt; and enjoyed them a lot more than I expected. The biggest thing I took away from them is that sports are quite closely tied to a lot of social phenomenon. The films, on their own, are also remarkable because each is made by a different film-maker, artist or athlete. Below is a list of my 11 favorite 30 for 30s with a short description or editorial comment on each. They aren&#39;t in ascending or descending order, just 11 favorites from the 30. A nod of the proverbial hat goes to my friend Darryl for recommending most of these as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Two Escobars&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left:30px;&quot;&gt;Pablo Escobar, arguably the world&#39;s most famous drug lord, had an unmatched passion for Columbian soccer and the soccer world had a conflicted relationship with him. The title can be taken to mean the two Escobars as in Andres Escobar, the star of the Columbian national team, or the two sides of Pablo Escobar: philanthropist and drug/war lord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:left;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Once Brothers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left:30px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Vlade Divac and Dražen Petrović had remarkable rises to fame in the NBA after playing together as teenagers in Yugoslavia. Political and ethnic tensions in their home country found their way into their once strong friendship. Petrovic died an untimely death in a car-accident and Divac retraces the roots of their friendship in this documentary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Pony Excess&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left:30px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Many have complained about college athletics taking attention away from academics or being tainted with poor ethics through bribery or monetary incentives for college athletes. This documentary takes Southern Methodist University in Dallas, Texas as a case study to explore college football&#39;s excesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. &lt;strong&gt;No Crossover: The Trial of Allen Iverson&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left:30px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;A racially charged story about Allen Iverson&#39;s involvement in a 1993 bowling alley brawl. Made by a resident of Hampton, Virginia where Iverson, Michael Vick and Lawrence Taylor are from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Winning Time: Reggie Miller vs. The New York Knicks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left:30px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;This was probably the most entertaining documentary of them all. Reggie Miller&#39;s antics on the court, Spike Lee&#39;s antics on the sideline and the drama that unfolded over multiple playoff series all make for a great story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. Straight Outta L.A.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left:30px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;The co-evolution of the L.A. raiders and gangster rap in L.A. The focus on the Raider logo and merchandise was especially interesting. Design and PR folks could probably draw one example after another out of this documentary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7. Without Bias&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left:30px;&quot;&gt;I didn&#39;t know much about Len Bias before watching this documentary. His career as a high school phenomenon, college star and first-round draft into the NBA all came to an end at his death following his cocaine use. The scenes featuring his mother and father were especially powerful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8. The U&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left:30px;&quot;&gt;Usually, unbridled showboating and bragging are a turn off. I&#39;ve always associated Miami with this kind of behavior. This documentary didn&#39;t change my judgment about that, but it did contextualize their success in some really interesting ways, not the least of which was the racial makeup of South Florida in the 70s, 80s and 90s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9. The House of Steinbrenner&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left:30px;&quot;&gt;New Yorkers like to win. The Yankees win, a lot. This documentary is about winning, but it also humanizes the organization and especially George Steinbrenner. It also features the most crying out of any of the documentaries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10. Run Ricky Run&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left:30px;&quot;&gt;On some level, this was the most interesting documentary for me. This profile of Ricky Williams, one of the NFLs most talented and promising running backs, shows a man battling with himself in so many ways. At one point, one of Williams&#39; family friends says something that really hit home for me and made sense of all of Williams&#39; troubles -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote style=&quot;padding-left:30px;&quot;&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left:30px;&quot;&gt;Ricky&#39;s identity formation was flawed, it became tightly linked to what he was supposed to be, to his achievements. He needed it to be rooted in sweet acceptance, so he could love himself. Ricky longed for that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;11. One Night in Vegas&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left:30px;&quot;&gt;This documentary is filmed as a graphic novel. It explores the relationship that Mike Tyson and Tupac Shakur had around the time of Tupac&#39;s death (the night of a Tyson fight in Vegas). It also features some really great spoken word poetry that hits home the comparisons between Tyson at his prime as a boxer and Tupac at his prime as a rapper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would be pretty awesome to give this treatment to some other topics. For me, political science, social science, economics, international relations, the presidency, fiscal policy and things of that sort come to mind. But really, any worthwhile topic would be interesting to ask 30 people to make hour-long documentaries about. Its not exhaustive by any means, but it would be fun.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Mac OSX Lion review</title>
   <link href="/technology/2011/07/20/mac-osx-lion-review/"/>
   <updated>2011-07-20T17:58:16-04:00</updated>
   <id>/technology/2011/07/20/mac-osx-lion-review</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://samarthbhaskar.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/lion.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-351 aligncenter&quot; title=&quot;Lion&quot; src=&quot;assets/lion.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;272&quot; height=&quot;304&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I downloaded and installed Mac OSX Lion this morning and have been messing around with it today. I don&#39;t think I can say any more in a review than &lt;a href=&quot;http://arstechnica.com/apple/reviews/2011/07/mac-os-x-10-7.ars&quot;&gt;John Siracusa of Ars Technica said in his 19-page review&lt;/a&gt; but a couple of things that I think are worth noting are listed below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. Its pretty remarkable how much Lion borrows from iOS (Apple&#39;s mobile OS). Instinctually, I would think a mobile OS is inspired by a desktop OS but with the ubiquity of smart phones and tablets, it makes perfect sense that the flow of innovation is now flowing both ways. This is abundantly clear in features like the new &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apple.com/macosx/whats-new/launchpad.html&quot;&gt;Launchpad &lt;/a&gt;which resembles the iOS Springboard, or the central focus on the Mac App Store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. The added &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apple.com/macosx/whats-new/gestures.html&quot;&gt;track-pad gestures &lt;/a&gt;are quite great. Since I project my desktop from Macbook Pro to an LCD screen with external mouse and keyboard, I feel like I&#39;m losing out on some functionality by using a traditional mouse. Some of the new gestures can be replicated with a 2-click external mouse, but many that require multiple fingers on the track-pad are best used either with the Macbook Pro track pad or external &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apple.com/magictrackpad/&quot;&gt;Magic track pad&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. While I like to delude myself that I can multi-task well on the computer, I know there are time where the ability to focus my attention on one task is important. The new&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apple.com/macosx/whats-new/full-screen.html&quot;&gt; full-screen&lt;/a&gt; feature for almost all apps is great for this. There were many work-arounds for this sort of thing before, but with Lion this feature is available on almost all apps, and you hardly lose any functionality while in full screen mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was also happy with the quick (and relatively cheap) download and upgrade through the App store. Unlike some others who had long waits or slow downloads, from start to finish my download and upgrade took around 40 minutes. I would be much more willing to upgrade or download apps and utilities if the process was this seamless. Looking ahead, it might become even less cumbersome with over-the-air updates in iOS 5 and whatever future iterations of Mac OS we can look forward to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>On metaphors</title>
   <link href="/books/commentary%20on%20works/social%20science/2011/07/15/on-metaphors/"/>
   <updated>2011-07-15T08:09:55-04:00</updated>
   <id>/books/commentary%20on%20works/social%20science/2011/07/15/on-metaphors</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The Chronicle of Higher Education has a &lt;a href=&quot;http://chronicle.com/article/Whats-a-Metaphor-For-/128079/&quot;&gt;review&lt;/a&gt; of James Geary&#39;s &lt;em&gt;I is an other&lt;/em&gt;, a new book on the place of metaphors in language. This quote from Geary was well received -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Metaphor conditions our interpretations of the stock market and, through advertising, it surreptitiously infiltrates our purchasing decisions. In the mouths of politicians, metaphor subtly nudges public opinion; in the minds of businesspeople, it spurs creativity and innovation. In science, metaphor is the preferred nomenclature for new theories and new discoveries; in psychology, it is the natural language of human relationships and emotions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although I wouldn&#39;t go as far as someone like Derrida, I think there is definitely value in the work of someone like George Lakoff who advanced the idea that metaphors are a conceptual (not merely linguistic) construction. His forays into political science, through things like conservative concepts of the paternal state versus progressive concepts of a maternal state, are pretty useful.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>William Faulkner on winning the Nobel Prize</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&quot;I believe that man will not merely endure: he will prevail. He is immortal, not because he alone among creatures has an inexhaustible voice, but because he has a soul, a spirit capable of compassion and sacrifice and endurance. The poet&#39;s, the writer&#39;s, duty is to write about these things.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Last Train Home (2009)</title>
   <link href="/culture%20and%20society/economics/international%20relations/movies/2011/07/01/last-train-home-2009/"/>
   <updated>2011-07-01T14:34:06-04:00</updated>
   <id>/culture%20and%20society/economics/international%20relations/movies/2011/07/01/last-train-home-2009</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1512201/&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-335&quot; title=&quot;lth&quot; src=&quot;assets/lth.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;303&quot; height=&quot;166&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1512201/&quot;&gt;Last Train Home (2009) &lt;/a&gt;is a Chinese documentary dedicated to migrant workers in China. It follows a family working to produce consumer goods for Western consumers that end up destroying the lives of the producers who hardly get paid a dime for their labor. It features heart-wrenching scenes of a father and mother committing themselves to arduous factory work only to see their son and daughter once a year during the Chinese New Year (only reaching them after being herded like cattle on crowded trains traveling between provinces). The entire film captures very well the emotions of the bleak reality of migrant workers&#39; lives. The &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Great-Stagnation-Low-Hanging-Eventually-ebook/dp/B004H0M8QS&quot;&gt;low-hanging fruit&lt;/a&gt;&quot; of China that has catapulted it to global economic success hardly benefits from these successes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the film is wrought with pain and strife, it comes highly recommended as a fantastic piece of work in film-making and also as a worthwhile look into migrant workers lives in China. I can only imagine that the struggles featured in this film are characteristic of struggles of workers around the world.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Education and economic output</title>
   <link href="/books/commentary%20on%20works/economics/politics/2011/07/01/education-and-economic-output/"/>
   <updated>2011-07-01T13:45:41-04:00</updated>
   <id>/books/commentary%20on%20works/economics/politics/2011/07/01/education-and-economic-output</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.spiked-online.com/index.php/site/reviewofbooks_article/10638/&quot;&gt;Hollowing out of the ivory tower&lt;/a&gt;&quot; Tim Black addresses Prof. Alison Wolf&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.co.uk/Does-Education-Matter-Economic-Business/dp/0140286608&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Does Education Matter? Myths About Education and Economic Growth&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Prof. Wolf&#39;s biggest criticism is that higher education has become far too mechanized and is merely an instrument to drive economic growth. She warns&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;An increase in the quantity of graduates will neither create a dynamic, wealth-producing economy nor will it create the conditions for the emergence of lots of dynamic, wealth-producing individuals. Universities are not what they are currently being cracked up to be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This leads to another problem&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Higher education has become central to the economic wellbeing of nations and individuals’, that it is becoming increasingly difficult to recall what the purpose of institutions of higher education might be. Their autonomy as academic bodies, in which one ought to be free to pursue an interest in a subject area to a higher level, has been effaced by their thoroughgoing instrumentalisation as drivers of economic growth and social mobility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;d say the correlation between education attainment and income potential is pretty well documented (its a pet example for instructors when picking social science data upon which to draw elementary formal models). However, this idea that the unintended consequence of viewing education attainment as an economic activity rather than a humanistic or perhaps political activity is worth note. Prof Wolf has written this book in the context of the UK but I think this warning readily applies to most advanced higher-education contexts, including the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Taking down Michael Lewis</title>
   <link href="/books/commentary%20on%20works/social%20science/2011/06/29/taking-down-michael-lewis/"/>
   <updated>2011-06-29T13:34:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>/books/commentary%20on%20works/social%20science/2011/06/29/taking-down-michael-lewis</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Michael Lewis has amassed quite a reputation on the back of his 2010 book &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Big-Short-Inside-Doomsday-Machine/dp/0393338827/ref=pd_cp_b_1&quot;&gt;The Big Short&lt;/a&gt;. I remember reading the book and listening to coverage on shows like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/355/the-giant-pool-of-money&quot;&gt;This American Life&#39;s The Giant Pool of Money &lt;/a&gt;in 2010 to try and understand the financial crisis. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2010/03/debunking-michael-lewis-subprime-short-hagiography.html&quot;&gt;This piece&lt;/a&gt;, however, has a lot to say about what Lewis missed in his book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lewis’ desire to satisfy his fan base’s craving for good guys led him to miss the most important story of our age: how a small number of operators used a nexus of astonishing leverage and camouflaged risk to bring the world financial system to its knees and miraculously walked away with their winnings. These players are not the ugly ducklings of Lewis’ fairy tale; they are merely ugly. Whether for his own profit or by accident, Lewis has denied the public the truth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can certainly understand the argument that Lewis was writing for a different audience (as perhaps Ezra Klein was in this &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/post/what-inside-job-got-wrong/2011/05/19/AGgGoJgH_blog.html&quot;&gt;piece&lt;/a&gt;, which was also &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2011/06/ezra-klein-should-stick-to-being-wrong-about-health-care.html#Topics&quot;&gt;rebuked&lt;/a&gt;) but I think after a cursory understanding is established, these kinds of nuanced complications are absolutely necessary for better policy building and informed decision making (including personal voting behavior) in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Jose Antonio Vargas in NYT - My Life As an Undocumented Immigrant</title>

   <updated>2011-06-22T12:30:38-04:00</updated>
   <id>/commentary%20on%20works/culture%20and%20society/washington%20dc/2011/06/22/jose-antonio-vargas-in-nyt-my-life-as-an-undocumented-immigrant</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/26/magazine/my-life-as-an-undocumented-immigrant.html?_r=1&amp;amp;src=tptw&amp;amp;pagewanted=all&quot;&gt;piece&lt;/a&gt; in the NYT by Pulitzer Prize winning journalist Jose Antonio Vargas is showing up every where today, and for good reason. Its a very moving account of an undocumented immigrant who has done everything he can to try and earn his place in the U.S. I, like everyone else talking about the piece, highly suggest reading it all but these lines at the end were the hardest hitting for me -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the real reason was, after so many years of trying to be a part of the system, of focusing all my energy on my professional life, I learned that no amount of professional success would solve my problem or ease the sense of loss and displacement I felt. I lied to a friend about why I couldn’t take a weekend trip to Mexico. Another time I concocted an excuse for why I couldn’t go on an all-expenses-paid trip to Switzerland. I have been unwilling, for years, to be in a long-term relationship because I never wanted anyone to get too close and ask too many questions. All the while, Lola’s question was stuck in my head: What will happen if people find out?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I certainly don&#39;t have a solution to the immigration concerns and as a naturalized immigrant myself, my views are colored but the idea of &quot;earning&quot; your citizenship seems amazingly loaded with moral evaluations and value judgments to me. Why is economic output or education attainment deemed a viable path to citizenship? Like I said, i don&#39;t know the answer to this or any of the related questions, but I do think it is important to ask these questions.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Still Bill (2009)</title>
   <link href="/commentary%20on%20works/movies/music/2011/06/15/still-bill-2009/"/>
   <updated>2011-06-15T18:56:01-04:00</updated>
   <id>/commentary%20on%20works/movies/music/2011/06/15/still-bill-2009</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;While reading &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.playboy.com/magazine/justin-timberlake-interview/2&quot;&gt;this Justin Timberlake interview&lt;/a&gt; I ran across a Bill Withers documentary called &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1333117/&quot;&gt;Still Bill&lt;/a&gt;. Here&#39;s what Justin Timberlake had to say about the film, and what it meant to him -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TIMBERLAKE: &lt;/strong&gt;You should watch the documentary &lt;em&gt;Still Bill.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PLAYBOY: &lt;/strong&gt;That’s the Bill Withers documentary, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TIMBERLAKE:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, and I’ve never watched anything else that made me feel someone was speaking not just to me but for me. He puts into words exactly how I feel about music. People asked Bill Withers all the time, “Why did you stop doing music?” Which is what I get asked all the time too. He said, “I don’t know what to say, because I didn’t stop doing music. I just started doing something else.” He also quoted Thoreau: “The mass of men live lives of quiet desperation.” Only Bill added, “I want to know what it feels like for my desperation to get louder.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PLAYBOY: &lt;/strong&gt;What does that mean to you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TIMBERLAKE:&lt;/strong&gt; Well, I relate to that because it means you need inspiration, you need to hear something loud inside yourself before you can create anything. Unfortunately, the business of music is what taints an artist’s desire to make music. I don’t want to paint a picture of being jaded, because I love making music. I honestly love it. But there is a level where making music becomes a total life-sucking commitment. For instance, to do an album and a tour, you have to be absolutely certain that whatever you have to say is from the heart, because you’re going to say it a thousand times—and on nights when you don’t feel like performing. You need to feel inspiration to get to a level where you’re performing like that. But I haven’t felt that level of conviction the past few years. And without that conviction it’s crazy to put yourself out there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After watching the documentary, I couldn&#39;t agree more. The film features Withers imparting short bits of his own philosophy that seems amazingly pragmatic but not void of any of the emotion that sometimes pragmatism lacks. It was heartening to see a man who achieved so much in life seem thankful for it, but never seem like he felt he deserved it or that it was owed to him. Withers struggled as a child with stuttering, came from humble beginnings in a coal-mining town in West Virginia and worked as a factory worker before stepping into fame as a musician - and I think that lent a lot to his ability to make the most of his life instead of expecting the most from his life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At one point he remarks, &quot;&quot;On the way to wonderful, you&#39;ll pass through all right. Stop and take a look around, because that&#39;s where you may be staying.&quot; As I move forward into my own career, I can happily take solace in this advice. I still plan on aiming at &quot;wonderful&quot; but I&#39;m happy to take a look around and &quot;alright&quot; and appreciate it on its own terms. In any case, the film comes highly recommended.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Eric Whitacre interviewed by Intelligent Life</title>

   <id>/commentary%20on%20works/culture%20and%20society/music/technology/2011/06/14/eric-whitacre-interviewed-by-intelligent-life</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Eric Whitacre, one of my favorite composers since high school, has a new &lt;a href=&quot;http://moreintelligentlife.com/blog/luiza-oleszczuk/qa-eric-whitacre&quot;&gt;interview up at Intelligent Life&lt;/a&gt;. I love following his career but I&#39;ve been sort of disappointed that a lot of his composing has been overshadowed by the glitz of his&lt;a href=&quot;http://ericwhitacre.com/the-virtual-choir&quot;&gt; virtual choir forays&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the interview, Whitacre talks about his nuanced relationship with technology. He claims that he still composes on paper, rather than on a computer, but that he enjoys being introduced to a lot of different kinds of music because of the web. I&#39;m glad that he isn&#39;t the type of person to just be completely technotopian (championing technology for any and every use) or completely technophobian (read: Luddite).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This anecdote about Debussy stirred some thoughts for me -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Paris, at the beginning of the 20th century, Debussy went to see a Gamelan orchestra and it completely changed his writing and basically blew his mind. But today I can go through 30 or 40 genres of music in one day, just by browsing the web, so the exposure to different kinds of music and therefore different ideologies is unprecedented. As a composer I know that all sorts of sounds I hear are making their way into my brain and soul, and later sneak into my music.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if the reason that Debussy had his mind blown was because he hadn&#39;t spent all that time being exposed to different kinds of music on the web? What about the possibility that Debussy was so entrenched in one form of composing that he reached a saturation point before he could truly have his mind blown by the Gamelan orchestra? I think claiming (although I don&#39;t think Whitacre is claiming this, but some have) that similar results may happen in a completely new cultural and information milieu is unreasoned.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Fareed Zakaria is on a book tour for the re-release of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/039308180X/ref=pd_lpo_k2_dp_sr_1?pf_rd_p=486539851&amp;amp;pf_rd_s=lpo-top-stripe-1&amp;amp;pf_rd_t=201&amp;amp;pf_rd_i=039306235X&amp;amp;pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;amp;pf_rd_r=0XTRE6MM9G53DF8BWMGB&quot;&gt;The Post American World&lt;/a&gt; and he stopped by the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2011/06/01/136825706/the-tuesday-podcast-fareed-zakarias-post-american-world&quot;&gt;Planet Money podcast recently&lt;/a&gt;. The podcast features an interesting conversation between Zakaria and the hosts Adam Davidson and Alex Blumberg. I&#39;ve never really thought Zakaria is a remarkable scholar or thinker but he is certainly one of the more impressive voices in the media (although that doesn&#39;t seem to be a difficult task to accomplish given our abysmal media landscape).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A short excerpt about the future for the U.S. I found interesting. This is something people have been saying for a while but as California&#39;s position worsens considerably and as the U.S. runs up against challenge after challenge, these words move from mere prognostication to reality -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Think of California as a metaphor. California has the most dazzling private sector in the world, really. If you think about Silicon Valley, plus Hollywood, plus all these things that spawn from it. It&#39;s amazing. And yet when the state is collapsing, when the infrastructure is collapsing, when you build more prisons than you do college campuses ... after a while it becomes very difficult to be a viable economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In the NY Times book review, Marcia Angell &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2011/jun/23/epidemic-mental-illness-why/?pagination=false&quot;&gt;reviews 3 new books&lt;/a&gt; on the topic of mental illness and the existing medical treatments. In one of the books, the author goes so far as to claim&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt; the relatively small difference between drugs and placebos might not be a real drug effect at all. Instead, it might be an enhanced placebo effect, produced by the fact that some patients have broken [the] blind and have come to realize whether they were given drug or placebo. If this is the case, then there is no real antidepressant drug effect at all. Rather than comparing placebo to drug, we have been comparing “regular” placebos to “extra-strength” placebos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think just as with advances in neuroscience based on increasing reliance on fMRI technology (including forays into fields like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.deepdyve.com/lp/psycarticles-reg/the-cognitive-neuroscience-toolkit-for-the-neuroeconomist-dEW5FpGXyY&quot;&gt;neuro-economics&lt;/a&gt; and so on) all of these claims are no better than theoretical conjectures at this point. However, the big difference between neuroscience and treatment for depression/anxiety/mental illness is that these treatments have real and sustained consequences for patients.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Louis CK on why he loves Bill Clinton</title>

   <id>/commentary%20on%20works/culture%20and%20society/politics/tv/2011/05/25/louis-ck-on-why-he-loves-bill-clinton</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In this &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.esquire.com/features/man-at-his-best/q-and-a/louis-ck-interview-0611&quot;&gt;interview with Louis CK&lt;/a&gt;, he mentions, among many other gems, why he and Chris Rock love Bill Clinton -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Me and Chris try to study a lot of different kinds of people, not just comedians. We both love Bill Clinton — Clinton is America&#39;s headliner. One of the greatest things I ever saw was him at Coretta Scott King&#39;s funeral. Jimmy Carter, George Bush Senior, Hillary — all these people making speeches, and then Bill Clinton goes on and he says, &quot;Let&#39;s all remember that that is a &lt;em&gt;woman&lt;/em&gt; lying right there.&quot; And he points at her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was audacious. &quot;That is a woman who had her dreams and her pain and her passions,&quot; and I think he said &quot;lust.&quot; He said really personal shit about her and you immediately heard the black people go, &quot;Yes!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He says, &quot;There&#39;s her &lt;em&gt;family&lt;/em&gt; — think about what they&#39;re going through today, and everything that&#39;s happened to them since their daddy got shot. The burden that must have been hers.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Holy shit. I hope to have &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; of that skill as a comic. He just found this short circuit. You try to have this nature the way water does — finds the lowest place and spreads the fuck out. That&#39;s what he did.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is of course not the first time I&#39;ve heard someone say such things about Clinton, but it may be the first time I&#39;ve heard a comedian say them.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Cornel West has come out recently against President Obama, calling him out on his pro-corporate behavior and overall disappointment as POTUS. In &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.truthdig.com/report/print/the_obama_deception_why_cornel_west_went_ballistic_20110516/&quot;&gt;this interview&lt;/a&gt; with Chris Hedges he has two main grievances with Obama, personal and political/ideological. Basically, West feels slighted by Obama for his inattention during the 2008 campaign and (more importantly) disappointed that Obama hasn&#39;t reigned in the influence of banks, corporations and the like on government over the course of his time in office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not merely a knee jerk reaction, but this just seems petty to me. Melissa Harris-Perry has some thoughts &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thenation.com/blog/160725/cornel-west-v-barack-obama&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; that I think may be important to consider (although this piece is somewhat petty in itself). My initial reaction to West&#39;s words earlier today was &quot;ugh&quot; and I stand by it.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Over the weekend I watched &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1255953/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Incendies&lt;/em&gt; (2010)&lt;/a&gt;, a French-Canadian film based on a play about a pair of siblings who are hurled down a journey down their mother&#39;s past in Lebanon, to answer some very important questions. The film is set up right away with an obvious &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacGuffin&quot;&gt;MacGuffin&lt;/a&gt; regarding an unknown father and brother, and it follows this quest along a path of historical events centered on the Lebanese Civil War. The film is enhanced by a knowledge of the basics of the Lebanese Civil War, but can certainly be understood without.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really enjoyed the film and recommend it highly. It is certainly not for the faint of heart, but the story is masterfully crafted and the film is beautifully put together.

   <title>Highly-skilled immigrants as low hanging fruit</title>

   <id>/books/commentary%20on%20works/international%20relations/politics/2011/05/12/highly-skilled-immigrants-as-low-hanging-fruit</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.slate.com/id/2293628/pagenum/all/&quot;&gt;Slate&lt;/a&gt; has a short piece addressing Cowen&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Great-Stagnation-Low-Hanging-Eventually-ebook/dp/B004H0M8QS&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Great Stagnation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, in particular the idea of &quot;low hanging fruit.&quot; The author here argues that highly-skilled immigrants may serve as another source of stimulation for the economy while the US tries to figure out how to move forward into the future. As an immigrant myself, my family and I have lived through the naturalization process that this article describes. I think the introduction of working visas and paths to citizenship for entrepreneurs is definitely very interesting and a worthwhile endeavor, although these critiques hold pretty true as well -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The legislation provides a few new paths to permanent residency for entrepreneurs. For instance, a prospective immigrant could win a temporary visa if she raises at least $100,000 from a qualified investor for a new business. Her visa would become permanent if, within two years, her business created five jobs and raised $500,000 in additional investment, or had sales of $500,000. The bill also encourages entrepreneurs on temporary and education visas to stay, and foreign business owners to move and expand operations here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a good idea, but perhaps still too restrictive. For one, the Startup Visa has inflexible rules about sales, capital investment, and job creation. What if a foreign-born computer scientist created the next Google in her garage, but by the end of two years only had a few thousand dollars in investment and one other worker? Second, the bill does not recognize the importance of failure. Most new businesses don&#39;t make it off the ground. But many entrepreneurs try again, and some succeed the second or third or 20&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; time around. Better to keep those aspirational workers on our shores. Third, and most important, the bill does not actually expand the number of available visas, just 9,940 in the relevant program. It just makes them easier for entrepreneurs to get.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think dis-aggregating the issue of immigration is one of the most difficult tasks in moving this issue forward, especially from a public opinion perspective. Its hard to bring up policy concerns and have fruitful conversations about this topic because its so often mired in debates about illegality, resource draining, racism and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>The reality of reality television</title>
   <link href="/commentary%20on%20works/culture%20and%20society/tv/2011/05/11/the-reality-of-reality-television/"/>

   <id>/commentary%20on%20works/culture%20and%20society/tv/2011/05/11/the-reality-of-reality-television</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;blockquote&gt;One of the biggest differences between today’s reality television and its 1973 antecedent is the genre’s status. Having outgrown PBS, it has inherited the rotten reputation that once attached to the medium itself. In an era of televised precocity—ambitious HBO dramas, cunningly self-aware sitcoms—reality shows still provide a fat target for anyone seeking symptoms or causes of American idiocy; the popularity of unscripted programming has had the unexpected effect of ennobling its scripted counterpart. The same people who brag about having seen every episode of “Friday Night Lights” will brag, too, that they have never laid eyes on “The Real Housewives of Atlanta.” Reality television is the television of television.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[...]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having logged those thousand hours, Pozner can attest that reality shows have a tendency to blur together into a single orgy of joy and disappointment and recrimination. In her view, this is no coincidence: the shows are constructed to reinforce particular social norms, she argues, and she finds examples from across the reality spectrum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From this New Yorker piece on reality TV. Its very interesting to think about the scripts of reality TV shows drawing from a pool populated by social norms. Usually art has a creator behind it, who has a purposeful intent in the way he/she is depicting life or a slice of life. I suppose in some ways if we all can draw from the same or similar pool of social norms, then it makes sense that a depiction of that on TV should be quite popular.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Wesley Yang has a &lt;a href=&quot;http://nymag.com/news/features/asian-americans-2011-5/&quot;&gt;long-form piece&lt;/a&gt; in the NY Mag that cuts and weaves its away across some pretty important issues of gender, power, social-mobility and self-actualization as they manifest themselves for many Asian-Americans. Originally, I thought this piece was kind of a re-hashing of old issues, but after talking to some people and thinking more about it, I think it addresses some concerns that a lot of people don&#39;t afford themselves the opportunity to address. Although it winds up talking about the over-discussed &lt;a href=&quot;http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704111504576059713528698754.html&quot;&gt;Amy Chua&lt;/a&gt; controvery, I think its worth the read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A short excerpt that I liked, maybe because I feel like I&#39;m in this place in my life now -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Throughout my twenties, I proudly turned away from one institution of American life after another (for instance, a steady job), though they had already long since turned away from me. Academe seemed another kind of death—but then again, I had a transcript marred by as many F’s as A’s. I had come from a culture that was the middle path incarnate. And yet for some people, there can be no middle path, only transcendence or descent into the abyss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was descending into the abyss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

   <title>Bringing causal models into the mainstream</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~cook/movabletype/archives/2011/05/bringing_causal.html&quot;&gt;Andrew Gelman&lt;/a&gt; points to &lt;a href=&quot;http://statisticsforum.wordpress.com/2011/05/10/bringing-causal-models-into-the-mainstream/&quot;&gt;John Johnson&lt;/a&gt; who has written a short piece about causal modeling in the mainstream. This blurb seems most important to me -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, that leaves the last point, which may cause some controversy. &quot;Do not try this at home.&quot; Causal analysis does not have a SAS proc or simple R routine (perhaps with the exception of two-stage least squares). This is going to have to come at the end of perhaps hours of data exploration, modeling, testing, rejecting, trying something else, and finally accepting. A causal model is not always going to be easy to write into a statistical analysis plan, and primary investigators may not want something so fluid in the plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although Johnson works primarily in the pharmaceutical industry where the processes of randomization and experiment design are quite rigorous, I think this point is quite important for the social sciences as well. Throughout this year I&#39;ve found that causal analysis is too often the goal of observational studies, when in fact they should perhaps be a lot more careful in making any strong causal inferences from (what is likely to quite flawed) data. I have taken some extra pains to do this in my MA thesis, and I&#39;m happier with it as a result.&lt;/p&gt;

Its a good reminder, for those who need reminding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m not sure about this claim here, seems dubious to me, but that&#39;s just a gut reaction for now -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet maybe the simplest way to save her life would have been contraception. If Somali women had half as many pregnancies (they now average six births), there would be only half as many maternal deaths. But modern contraception doesn’t exist in this part of Somaliland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;She accepted the post, in November of 2008, only after President-Elect Obama—in an inspired move over the objections of many on his campaign staff—twisted not just her arm, she informed friends, but her fingers, toes, and every other bone in her body. The president, for his part, is proud of himself for choosing her. He knows that she represents the United States better than anyone but him and is—to the surprise of many Obama veterans—refreshingly low-maintenance. When budget season arrived this year and the departments all faced drastic cuts, Hillary used a Cabinet meeting to offer tips on how to avoid making cuts that would affect vulnerable people—children, the elderly—and look bad politically. (She recalled that Newt Gingrich’s effort to slash the school-lunch program, which put Gingrich on the defensive, was the real turning point in the 1995 budget debate.) Several second-tier Cabinet members thought it one of the most useful White House meetings they had ever attended.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DFW:&lt;/strong&gt; The reason why doing political writing is so hard  right now is probably also the reason why more young (am I included in  the range of this predicate anymore?) fiction writers ought to be doing  it. As of 2003, the rhetoric of the enterprise is fucked. 95 percent of  political commentary, whether spoken or written, is now polluted by the  very politics it’s supposed to be about. Meaning it’s become totally  ideological and reductive: The writer/speaker has certain political  convictions or affiliations, and proceeds to filter all reality and spin  all assertion according to those convictions and loyalties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

   <title>Paul Krugman's "How I work"</title>

   <updated>2011-01-10T13:21:18-05:00</updated>
   <id>/commentary%20on%20works/politics/2011/01/10/krugman-how-i-work</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I ran across this essay by Paul Krugman entitled &quot;How I work&quot; in which he chronicles his research philosophy and lays out a quick trajectory of how he got where he is today. It was a really interesting read. If for no other reason, it was interesting to see a public intellectual discuss his personal journey and outline his professional/academic methodology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His rules of research include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Listen to the Gentiles&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. Question the question&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. Dare to be silly&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4. Simplify, simplify&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The section on engagement with the policy-sphere was something I found particularly interesting. This is something I aspire to do. I aim to (successfully, I hope) toe that line between high level academic research and policy consulting. It was good to receive validation from someone who set out on that path early in his career and was able to make strong contributions in both arenas.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Black Swan (2010)</title>
   <link href="/2010/12/13/black-swan-2010/"/>
   <updated>2010-12-13T17:42:14-05:00</updated>
   <id>/2010/12/13/black-swan-2010</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I got to check out &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0947798/&quot;&gt;Black Swan&lt;/a&gt; last weekend when it opened, and wanted to write something about it for a while but because of finals, I couldn&#39;t get to it until now. One of my friends shared this &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.charlierose.com/view/interview/11324&quot;&gt;Charlie Rose interview&lt;/a&gt; with me earlier today, and it really sparked the same thoughts (and some new ones) I had last week once again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the strongest feelings I walked away with was how much the movie felt like Darren Aronofsky&#39;s other works, and most closely the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1125849/&quot;&gt;The Wrestler (2008)&lt;/a&gt;. Aronofsky explained the resemblances in the Charlie Rose interview (as explorations of high art and low art, of the use of bodies in entertainment), but to me the most profound similarity was what I felt Aronofsky was saying to the audience at the end of each movie. Both The Wrestler and Black Swan end with applause in the background, but with a strong sense of want or disappointment lingering for the viewer (I&#39;ll hold off on saying more on that so as not to spoil the ending for those who have yet to see it).  I took this to be Aronofsky&#39;s way of saying &quot;Are you happy? Do you see what these entertainers have gone through to try and appease your insatiable appetite? Is this what you want?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Charlie Rose interview, Natalie Portman also brought up some really interesting points about the movie that bear heavily on my own current state in personal development. Portman described her transformation in the movie from a &quot;ballet girl&quot; to a &quot;woman,&quot; as one which mirrors her real-life transformation into womanhood. One of the ways the movie portrays this is by Nina (Portman&#39;s character) moving away from trying to please everyone else and finding her own pleasure. This was a fascinating commentary on adulthood to me. I think too often personal focus is seen as childish, selfish or unbecoming of a well-functioning adult. In fact, I think the idea of finding your own pleasure is a great way to conceptualize ownership of yourself and your own happiness in adulthood, something I am working on for myself recently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Black Swan is a fantastic artifact of film-making. It is meta-cognitive, highly subjective, beautifully scored and a much needed film in what seems like a drought in high quality films recently.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Ain&#39;t It Cool News announced &lt;a href=&quot;http://http://www.aintitcool.com/node/47547&quot;&gt;a competition&lt;/a&gt; today for 10 spots to see a special screening of Darren Aronofsky&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0947798/&quot;&gt;Black Swan&lt;/a&gt; in Chicago on Monday. One of the stipulations of the competition was to include a short blurb on what your favorite movie about madness is and why. Below is what I sent in regarding The Conversation, a 1974 film starring Gene Hackman and directed by Francis Ford Coppola.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coppola&#39;s directing, the haunting score and Hackman&#39;s lifetime performance all really made for a terrific film. Hackman&#39;s character is a microcosm for 20th century America for me, his attention is so focused on being the best, that he doesn&#39;t realize how much he&#39;s screwing up in other facets of his life. I also think there is a lot going on in the character that speaks to every-day madness. The kind of madness that builds on itself and never goes over the edge to truly raise suspicion, but for the person experiencing it, it can almost ruin daily life. That&#39;s the kind of madness the majority of people deal with, the kind of that doesn&#39;t turn violent but still eats away at the hope of a &quot;normal&quot; life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hope I get to see the screening on Monday!&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A friend of mine mentioned this speech to me the other day. I had never heard of it before, especially with Obama&#39;s 2004 DNC address being the most popular speaking event connected with the DNC in my recently developed political conscience. I finally got around to reading the speech and I had to share it. My friend described it as a &quot;seminal piece of rhetoric in liberal political ideology&quot; and I couldn&#39;t have put it better myself.

   <title>Are political orientations genetically transmitted?</title>
   <link href="/commentary%20on%20works/politics/2010/11/09/are-political-orientations-genetically-transmitted/"/>
   <updated>2010-11-09T13:03:08-05:00</updated>
   <id>/commentary%20on%20works/politics/2010/11/09/are-political-orientations-genetically-transmitted</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;blockquote&gt;Individual genes for behaviors do not exist and no one denies that humans have the capacity to act against genetic predispositions. But predictably dissimilar correlations of social and political attitudes among people with greater and lesser shared genotypes suggest that behaviors are often shaped by forces of which the actors themselves are not consciously aware, a point that is made with some force by Bargh and Chartrand (1999), Marcus (2002), Marcus, Neuman, and MacKuen (2000), McDermott (2004), and Wegner (2002). It is not biological determinism to posit the existence of complex collections of genes that increase the probability that certain people will display heightened or deadened response patterns to given environmental cues. And it is not antibehavioralism to suggest that true explanations of the source of political attitudes and behaviors will be found when we combine our currently detailed understanding of environmental forces with a recognition that genetic variables subtly but importantly condition human responses to environmental stimuli.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a 2005 study - Alford, J., et al. 2005. “Are political orientations genetically transmitted?” American Political Science Review.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Certainly a very emotional and political topic in itself, but the study includes some convincing evidence for the strong correlations between genetic similarity and development of political attitudes. The quoted paragraph probably strikes closest to my own conceptualization of what genetic determinism and social construction mean in observable behavior and attitudes.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Hackneyed "Clash of Civilizations"</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;As long as I have studied the Middle East (which is coming up on 5 years now) Samuel Huntington&#39;s legacy has been inescapable. I have, on so many occasions, engaged in arguments (personal, professional and academic) that are centered around his basic premise of a clash of civilizations between what he calls the West and the Islamic civilization. I can&#39;t even remember how many papers I have written or people I have tried to confront about the shortcomings of this &quot;seminal&quot; work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, Lisa Wedeen puts my thoughts in a pithy and succinct manner -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;This understanding of culture as a specific group’s primordial values or traits is untenable empirically. It ignores the historical conditions and relevant power relationships that give rise to political phenomena such as “democratization,” ethnic conflicts, and contemporary radical Islamicist movements. The group traits version of culture, moreover, rides roughshod over the diversity of views and the experiences of contention within the group or groups under study. In the case of Huntington’s depiction of the Middle East, for ex- ample, such claims of sedimented essences have led scholars of culture to pass over such now obviously urgent matters as the contemporary nature of Islamicist movements, the causes of their recent emergence, and the ways in which communities of argument exist over what makes a Muslim a Muslim, what Islam means, and what, if any, its political role should be. Treating culture as a set of traits that purportedly distinguish one group from another also neglects the terrains of solidarity and fluidity that exist among groups, the ways in which political communities of various sorts have depended on the cross-fertilization of ideas and practices. In short, by ignoring historical processes and specific relations of political power, the treatment of culture in political science has downplayed the heterogeneous ways in which people experience the social order within and among groups, while exaggerating the commonality, constancy, and permanence of intragroup beliefs and values.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

   <title>Mortality Salience and Ideology</title>
   <link href="/commentary%20on%20works/grad%20school/politics/2010/10/13/mortality-salience-and-ideology/"/>
   <updated>2010-10-13T12:55:49-04:00</updated>
   <id>/commentary%20on%20works/grad%20school/politics/2010/10/13/mortality-salience-and-ideology</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve been reading a lot about ideology for a class recently and there have been a few insights that I&#39;ve found to be pretty beneficial, beyond their use for academic purposes. One of the most interesting findings in the studies I&#39;ve been reading is the concept of mortality salience (making subjects aware of the end of their own lives). Although there are a host of factors that contribute to the development of ideology (societal construction, heredity, childhood development, education, cognitive dispositions, &amp;amp;c), mortality salience was one that I had never really considered on its own merit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;MORTALITY SALIENCE AND EXPRESSED POLITICAL ATTITUDES&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;For example, mortality salience appears to produce greater patriotism and hostility toward critics of one’s nation, a stronger endorsement of the unique validity of one’s own religion, stronger support for traditional gender norms, greater attention to established norms of proce- dural fairness, increased levels of stereotyping, and a generally stronger preference for aggres- sive responses to individuals and groups who are perceived as threatening to the cultural world- view&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MORTALITY SALIENCE, AUTHORITARIANISM, AND SELECTIVE EXPOSURE TO POLITICAL INFORMATION&lt;br /&gt;
An experiment by Lavine et al. (2005) revealed that a mortality salience manipulation led high (but not low) authoritarians to se- lectively expose themselves to information in a manner that was consistent with their position on capital punishment. This find- ing suggests that not everyone responds to threatening stimuli in the same manner (see also Davis &amp;amp; Silver 2004, Stenner 2005). It is important to point out, however, that low authoritarians did not show greater open-mindedness (or a decrease in selective ex- posure) following mortality salience priming (Lavine et al. 2005, p. 232). Lavine et al. (2005) concluded their article by emphasiz- ing elective affinities, that is, “interactions between dispositional motivational needs and cognitive styles on one hand, and ex- igencies of the social and political environment on the other” (p. 240). Specifically, they suggested that those who tune into “the now ubiquitous format of one-sided (generally right-wing) talk radio (e.g., Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity, Michael Savage, Bill O’Reilly)” are motivated not merely by chronic anger and resentment but that “viewers’ preferences for one-sided vs ‘fair and balanced’ formats are at least partly a function of perceived environmental threat” (p. 240).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Certainly an interesting phenomena when applied in combination with demographics of aging voters, or in combination with religious groups.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Foucault vs. Chomsky</title>
   <link href="/commentary%20on%20works/culture%20and%20society/talks/2010/10/05/foucault-vs-chomsky/"/>
   <updated>2010-10-05T17:51:42-04:00</updated>
   <id>/commentary%20on%20works/culture%20and%20society/talks/2010/10/05/foucault-vs-chomsky</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;There&#39;s a short (13 minute) &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x32axv_chomsky-vs-foucault-1971&quot;&gt;video from 1971&lt;/a&gt; of  a discussion between Noam Chomsky and Michel Foucault that I think gets at so much of what I&#39;ve delved into (academically and personally) for the last few years of my life. In fact, I think I&#39;ve been thinking about this for much longer, I just wasn&#39;t able to articulate it too well until a few years ago. The discussion, &lt;a href=&quot;http://books.google.com/books?id=L4AQAQAAIAAJ&amp;amp;q=foucault+versus+chomsky&amp;amp;dq=foucault+versus+chomsky&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;ei=q7erTJ_5NYu2ngfy09XJBg&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;oi=book_result&amp;amp;ct=result&amp;amp;resnum=1&amp;amp;ved=0CCUQ6AEwAA&quot;&gt;and the longer book,&lt;/a&gt; gets at some of the most profound yet basic arguments in social science, politics, religion, philosophy and really any endeavor in human development. The most pedestrian conceptualization of this argument is the age-old &quot;nature vs. nurture&quot; debate. In a crude sense, Chomsky falls more on the nature side of the debate and Foucault favors nurture in the fight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Essentially, Chomsky argues that human nature seeks and needs creative outlet and that is something that we must strongly consider when establishing our social structures. Foucault responds by questioning Chomsky&#39;s understanding of human nature, claiming that we will never be able to truly understand human nature because we are mired in our own cultural production (informed by the politics, knowledge, philosophy, religion, &amp;amp;c. of the time) of &quot;human-nature&quot; as a concept.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a social scientist, and someone who has written works using Foucaultian lenses in the past, I suppose it comes as no surprise that I side with Foucault more often than not. But what is most interesting to me is that I find myself coming back, again and again to Chomsky. Maybe its because he&#39;s an elegant, unassuming yet capturing speaker and writer. Maybe its because he is the model of a public intellectual, something that I hope one day to be myself. Maybe its because he has done so much terrific work in other (related) fields like linguistics and media studies. Or maybe because his quantitative and technical skills pull at the parts of my brain that easily get convinced of things when explained using the language of mathematics (not because I understand it better, but because I&#39;ve mostly been socialized to think that math is not an argument, its a fact). Whatever the reason, Chomsky has always caught my attention because I think there is certain truth in what he says. His canonical contributions to the study of language acquisition and language development have yet to be thoroughly disproved. And maybe there truly is a human nature that can be understood, and coupled with our fight to uncover power structures in society (as Foucault promotes), we can do a better job of developing social structures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&#39;t believe I will ever get to a place where I can confidently say I side with either nature or nurture in the debate (mostly because I don&#39;t think its ever either/or) but the inquiry into these fields and the analysis of any work I commit to through the lens of this debate seems to be a never-ending prospect.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Social Network (2010) and Catfish (2010)</title>
   <link href="/commentary%20on%20works/culture%20and%20society/movies/2010/10/04/social-network-2010-and-catfish-2010/"/>
   <updated>2010-10-04T09:39:29-04:00</updated>
   <id>/commentary%20on%20works/culture%20and%20society/movies/2010/10/04/social-network-2010-and-catfish-2010</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Over the weekend, I saw Social Network and Catfish (back to back, in fact). It has been a while since I have been impressed with theatrical releases, so this weekend was a great re-introduction into worthwhile contemporary films.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1584016/&quot;&gt;Catfish&lt;/a&gt; is a documentary about an artist based in New York and his interactions with a family in rural Michigan. If I say any more about the film, I will invariably ruin it. I was fortunate enough to go see it without any idea what it was about (based purely on recommendations from my close friends) and ended up enjoying it a lot. Some things that are important to keep in mind are the fact that it is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.austin360.com/movies/catfish-makers-say-their-film-really-is-a-922498.html&quot;&gt;100% real&lt;/a&gt; and that there will be moments in the movie where you think you&#39;ve gleaned the moral already, but you really &lt;a href=&quot;http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20100922/REVIEWS/100929991&quot;&gt;have to wait until the end &lt;/a&gt;to get everything it has to offer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Social Network was a terrific adventure in film-making. It had me hooked from the first dialog scene, and kept me intently engaged the entire time. I thought Aaron Sorkin did a wonderful job adapting the screenplay from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Accidental-Billionaires-Founding-Facebook-Betrayal/dp/0307740986&quot;&gt;Ben Mezrich book&lt;/a&gt;, the editing and packaging of the film was terrific and David Fincher excelled in his role as a director (one of my friends whom I saw the movie with was bent on arguing that it was his best film yet).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With reference to the subject matter of Social Network, I thought the film-makers did what they had to do, which was to take a pretty complex set of events, and create a viable story out of it, to tell the audience. All the vitriol and backlash about inaccuracies and poor portrayals of &lt;a href=&quot;http://gawker.com/5643915/mark-zuckerberg-describes-the-dirty-tricks-that-led-to-the-facebook-movie&quot;&gt;Zuckerberg may be well-founded&lt;/a&gt;, but that is not the purpose of a film, as a piece of art. One argument that I did find especially beneficial to read was &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tnr.com/article/books-and-arts/78081/sorkin-zuckerberg-the-social-network&quot;&gt;Larry Lessig&#39;s reaction in The National Review&lt;/a&gt;. He argues, in essence, that the film missed an opportunity to make some really important commentary on the nature of an enterprise like Facebook being so different from other successful enterprises in the past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all, it was a great movie weekend, and both of the aforementioned films come highly recommended from me.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Unipolarity and Multipolarity in the International System</title>
   <link href="/2010/09/29/unipolarity-and-multipolarity-in-the-international-system/"/>
   <updated>2010-09-29T20:22:44-04:00</updated>
   <id>/2010/09/29/unipolarity-and-multipolarity-in-the-international-system</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I spent part of today reading through two important pieces (some would say canonical pieces in International Relations theory) on the stability of an international system characterized by multipolarity or unipolarity. A great debate in international relations is centered on the argument of whether we currently inhabit a unipolar or multi-polar system, obviously with the United States as the focus of the unipolar world (if that is what exists). My purpose here is not to discuss whether we live in  multi-polar or unipolar system (incidentally, I&#39;m of the mindset that we live in a multi-polar world), I am interested in taking up the notion of stability. Stability is defined by a maintenance of the status quo, without adding or subtracting the core number of great powers in the international system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pieces, full citations below, construct basic syllogisms that argue on either side. &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth_Waltz&quot;&gt;Kenneth Waltz &lt;/a&gt;argues, in essence, that a bipolar world is in fact the most stable and durable for peace in the international system. His major contribution to this syllogism is the idea that, in a multi-polar world there are more opportunities for miscalculations between the many alliances and groupings that form, leading to more instability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://sitemaker.umich.edu/jdsinger/home&quot;&gt;Singer&lt;/a&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Deutsch&quot;&gt;Deutsch&lt;/a&gt; argue that a multi-polar system is in fact more stable because the major powers have more incentive and opportunity for cooperation and are more likely to have their attention diffused from just focusing on one polar antagonist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although Waltz&#39;s logic is much stronger and presents a difficult obstacle to overcome in trying to break it down, I would have to side with Singer &amp;amp; Deutsch because I do see multi-polar systems, with their increased opportunities for cooperation and interaction to be far more stable and conducive to peaceful interaction than bipolar systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, all of these calculations and theories are complicated ten-fold in reality with the question of terrorism, non-state actors, rogue states and non-military inputs. None the less, I think it&#39;s a worthwhile analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>The Post-American World by Fareed Zakaria</title>

   <id>/commentary%20on%20works/international%20relations/middle%20east/2010/09/28/the-post-american-world-by-fareed-zakaria</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I just finished&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Post-American-World-Fareed-Zakaria/dp/039306235X&quot;&gt; The Post-American World by Fareed Zakaria&lt;/a&gt;. It was a quick read since it mostly feels like a long-form journalistic essay, more than a tough piece of non-fiction. I didn&#39;t particularly find anything about this book to be earth-shattering or controversial, but it was a fair description of the ways in which the global system is undergoing important changes, with the U.S. still at the center.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a nutshell, Zakaria argues that the U.S. is still enjoying a hegemonic unipolar status in the world and certain economic, military and social blunders notwithstanding, America is not being challenged for its primacy in any major way. He spends a good chunk of the book praising China and India for their successes and describing all the ways in which their growth and progress is shaping the international system. He laments on the excess in politics, technology and economics that has led to some of the ills in the world today. He argues about security in a unipolar world and the existence of the major power outside the realm of the system of international initiatives (something I plan on taking up on this blog later this week).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the more interesting thoughts I took from the book was a footnote near the end about Zakaria&#39;s position on Iraq and the invasion of 2003. Here it is, replicated below -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It is not a subject for this book, but I was in favor of the effort to oust Saddam Hussein, though I argued from the start for a much larger force and an internationally sanctioned intervention and occupation. My reasoning was mostly related to the fact that Western policy toward Iraq had collapsed-sanctions were leaking, countless civilians were dying because of the embargo, Al Qaeda was enraged by our base in Saudi Arabia, from which we operated the No Fly Zone-and I believed that a more modern and moderate Iraq in the middle of the Arab world would help break the dysfunctional political dynamics of the Arab world. I opposed, from the first few weeks, Washington&#39;s occupation policies. In retrospect, I underestimated not merely the administration&#39;s arrogance and incompetence but also the inherent difficulty of the task. I continue to believe that a modern, moderate Iraq would make an important difference in the politics of the Middle East, I hope that Iraq will, in the long run, evolve into such a place, but the costs have been ruinously high-for Americans, for America&#39;s reputation, but especially for Iraqis. And foreign policy is a matter of costs and benefits, not theology.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought this passage was especially interesting because Zakaria writes honestly about his support for the deposing of Hussein and the evolution in his thought processes, leading him to where he is today. Most left-of-center thinkers would be quick to dismiss ever having supported intervention efforts, based primarily on the folly that the situation has turned into today. Zakaria&#39;s honesty here is commendable.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>The work of a face, hands and feet on the mind</title>

   <id>/commentary%20on%20works/culture%20and%20society/music/2010/09/25/the-work-of-a-face-hands-and-feet-on-the-mind</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In a crowded, dark theater in Downtown Chicago, after a long day of work is not where you expect to find yourself immersed in thought about human connection but that is exactly where I happened to find myself on Wednesday evening. Performing as part of the Chicago World Music Festival, &lt;a href=&quot;http://anjalchande.com/&quot;&gt;Anjal Chande&lt;/a&gt; presented an hour-long performance, comprised of four pieces that blended her mastery of the South-Asian classical dance form Bharatnatyam and her contemporary artistic sensibilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although a dancer by training, Anjal showcased her art through a variety of media. Her spoken word, set to music composed by famed Sitarist Gaurav Mazumdar, Hindustani classical singer Gaurav Venkteswar and collegiate a cappella group Chai-Town (composed and directed by Arjun Venkataswamy) all provided backdrops to Anjal’s dance that pulled the audience into the performance. Anjal brought the audience in closer with her use of her face, hands and feet. The emotive expressions on her face, the meaningful use of her hands and the rhythmic cadence of her feet all worked together to accent the frame of a dancer who commanded not only the stage she performed on but the attention and emotions of her audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anjal explored ideas of thought, creativity, darkness, happiness and human connection with her original pieces. Tapping into the urban lifestyle and its ephemeral nature, Anjal developed one of her pieces around distractions in the mind and the inevitable frustrations that grow out of constant yet shallow contact. In “Darkness,” Anjal proposed that happiness actually lives in darkness and that our imagination is not something to be feared, but something to be coveted. In her final piece, Anjal released her larger-than-life-self onto the stage, darting to and fro while having a delightful conversation with the music she danced to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout her performance, I found myself fixated on Anjal’s artistic thoughts. She created an entire habitat for me, and the audience, to explore ideas that she brought forth. Without any realization that I was doing it, I found myself meandering through my own conceptualizations of happiness, imagination, darkness, distraction and expression. In this, Anjal accomplished something that artists hope to accomplish with every expression. She presented her art with confidence and her real self shined on stage. Anjal embodied, almost literally, her convictions and painted them in an aesthetic that was irresistible for the audience. The entire performance was memorable not because it was foreign or her specific interpretation on human connection, but because it was personal and familiar and reminded me of my own convictions.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Higher literacy thanks to Bollywood</title>
   <link href="/commentary%20on%20works/international%20relations/media%20studies/technology/2010/09/22/higher-literacy-thanks-to-bollywood/"/>

   <id>/commentary%20on%20works/international%20relations/media%20studies/technology/2010/09/22/higher-literacy-thanks-to-bollywood</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The Boston Globe has a new &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/ideas/articles/2010/09/19/watch_and_learn/?page=1&quot;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; up today about some research about how music videos are leading to booming literacy rates in rural India -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Same-language subtitling extricates literacy from the tangles of school  infrastructure and teacher availability. And since television, more than  any other medium, has the power to reach out to billions across the  developing world, it holds unique promise for hard-to-access groups like  rural women, who are discouraged from venturing outside their villages  once they hit puberty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Essentially, the broadcasting of music videos with same-language subtitles has led to a noticeable increase in literacy and functional literacy rates in rural villages in parts of India. By extension, it&#39;s common to notice that progress in societies is often part and parcel with literacy rates, and especially literacy rates among women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Extending this observation further, I think it is important to consider the social value systems that are also being transmitted, along with reading skills, through these music videos. Media theorists, one after another, have brought attention to the idea that the medium through which something is communicated (or in this case taught) carries with it important values, limitations, assumptions and consequences. Educating rural citizens of India through Bollywood music videos could very well lead to a clash in value systems that are characteristic of rural Indian societies versus those found more often in Bollywood films. Although I think these are valid concerns, it goes without saying that higher literacy is a social good that is beneficial, almost without caveat.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Math Camp</title>
   <link href="/general/grad%20school/2010/09/21/math-camp/"/>
   <updated>2010-09-21T20:55:56-04:00</updated>
   <id>/general/grad%20school/2010/09/21/math-camp</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The last 9 days of my life have been focused around an intensive quantitative survey called Math Camp. It was offered as a voluntary pre-term course to all students entering the social sciences graduate fields to either strengthen existing quantitative skills or be introduced to new quantitative concepts that the department encourages the students to have a better mastery over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the 9 days we studied complex sets, numbers and functions, single-variable integral and differential calculus, matrix algebra, multi-variable calculus and probability &amp;amp; statistics. Of the different quantitative fields, I have the strongest background in statistics, which was strengthened further this summer at my internship at a polling firm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was most surprised at how much retention and comprehension power I had over such complex topics just over the span of 9 days. The course was filled with nearly 6 months worth of instructional material, condensed into 9 days. What I really took away from it was the idea of setting a higher standard of instruction and assuming far more capacity to excel from students than has been the norm in my academic career thus far. I have found too much time wasted and too many goals or skills confounded by the idea that students are not smart enough to grasp concepts, students need to be spoon-fed or some perverse form of lack of confidence. I found great merit in the confidence the instructor had in his pacing and abilities as an instructor and in us as the students. I do not claim (at all) to be have mastery of the concepts I was introduced to, but I am sufficiently impressed by the ways in which this model of instruction succeeded.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>On hyper-links</title>
   <link href="/commentary%20on%20works/media%20studies/technology/2010/09/20/on-hyper-links/"/>
   <updated>2010-09-20T20:24:57-04:00</updated>
   <id>/commentary%20on%20works/media%20studies/technology/2010/09/20/on-hyper-links</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I’ve been re-reading my way through some of the books on my bookshelf, and I picked up &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Internet-Thinking-Action-Hurbert-Dreyfus/dp/0415228077&quot;&gt;On the Internet by Hubert L. Dreyfus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; the other day. I think it was a required reading for a class at some point but it has been an interesting re-read. One of the first topics Dreyfus takes on is the practice of hyper-linking on the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theshallowsbook.com/nicholascarr/The_Shallows.html&quot;&gt;Nicholas Carr took to critiquing this practice&lt;/a&gt; not too long ago, claiming that hyper-links in articles caused more distractions than they provided substantive or important content (something I’m trying to work on in my own writing). Dreyfus considers hyper-linking practice on web pages and blogs to be similarly disorienting and distracting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dreyfus laments on the disjointed nature of hyper-links and an abundance of information that is available on the Internet without any measure of relevance and importance to the reader. He posits that the way to create true meaning out of hyper-links online is to somehow embody them, by connecting them to embodied experience. He is of the opinion that because the Internet exists completely outside the body, it can never carry the same relevance, risk and importance as embodied knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found these assertions to be particularly curious given the reason why hyper-linking was first utilized during the nascent stages of the Internet. Tim Berners-Lee, one of the proposed inventors of the Internet as we know it today, developed and popularized the hyper-linking system to mimic the way he noticed people made memories, which was through building relationships between new pieces of information and information already situated in the psyche.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So although the argument Dreyfus makes stands, I find it peculiar when weighed against the intentions of hyper-linking, as it was first created. I suppose hardly anything ever pans out as it was first intended, but there is certainly some merit to the intention of hyper-links and certainly some doubt as to why in practice they have become so disjointed and distracting.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Pessimism (but not what you're thinking)</title>
   <link href="/commentary%20on%20works/culture%20and%20society/2010/09/18/pessimism-but-not-what-youre-thinking/"/>

   <id>/commentary%20on%20works/culture%20and%20society/2010/09/18/pessimism-but-not-what-youre-thinking</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;While perusing my subscriptions on Google Reader yesterday (which is something I do entirely way too much during my waking hours), I ran across &lt;a href=&quot;http://modeledbehavior.com/2010/09/17/great-minds-and-all-that/&quot;&gt;this blog post&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;strong&gt;Modeled Behavior&lt;/strong&gt; about a new book entitled &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Uses-Pessimism-Danger-False-Hope/dp/0199747539/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;qid=1284722052&amp;amp;sr=8-1/marginalrevol-20&quot;&gt;&quot;The Uses of Pessimism: And the Danger of False Hope.&quot;&lt;/a&gt; In it Karl Smith quickly points to and adds his thoughts on pessimism and aiming for rational progress. (Tyler Cowen also &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2010/09/the-uses-of-pessimism.html&quot;&gt;pointed to the same book&lt;/a&gt; over at &lt;strong&gt;MR&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While reading the post, I was reminded of a quote from Albert Camus - &quot;Man is the only creature that refuses to be what he is.&quot; Camus was alluding to the idea that by recognizing who we are (including our many limitations) we can successfully be something more, something better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s is a worthwhile proposition, in my opinion. I come from a mentality of shying away from pessimism, from turning a deaf ear and a blind eye to it. I have long considered pessimists to be nihilist, defeatist in their approach and to have a misappropriated lack of vision. However, in allowing myself to review my own biases, I think it is important to consider the utility of pessimism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In reference to the book and the commentary by Smith and Cowen, I find great merit in using pessimism to revise institutions, actions, and traditions. These reviews must be grounded in reality, which author Roger Scruton believes eludes optimists through their denial of the confounded and manipulated realities of humanity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a believer in the progress of our human kind being almost completely based on the random filtering of an unbelievable amount of inputs (speaking evolutionarily), I think it falls in line for me to believe in the merits of pessimism since not all but only a few selected inputs brought us where we are today, and not all but only a few selected inputs will move us forward.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>New Yorker's 20 writers under 40</title>
   <link href="/commentary%20on%20works/culture%20and%20society/2010/09/16/new-yorkers-20-writers-under-40/"/>
   <updated>2010-09-16T20:28:08-04:00</updated>
   <id>/commentary%20on%20works/culture%20and%20society/2010/09/16/new-yorkers-20-writers-under-40</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The New Yorker has a &lt;a title=&quot;piece&quot; href=&quot;http://www.newyorker.com/fiction/20-under-40/writers-q-and-a&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;piece&lt;/a&gt; online about 20 writers under 40 in which they ask all the writers the same set of questions and also link to some great pieces that these writers have contributed to the magazine in the recent past. One of the most interesting questions in the Q-and-A is &quot;did you ever consider not becoming a writer?&quot; The answers are somewhat varied, but almost without fail amount to some version of &quot;Yes. Duh.&quot; Here are a couple of my favorites&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.newyorker.com/fiction/features/2010/06/14/100614fi_fiction_20under40_qa_jonathan-safran-foer&quot;&gt;Jonathan Safran Foer &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Did  I ever. Do I ever. For a long time, I thought I would like to be a  doctor. Such a good profession. So explicitly good. Never a waste of  time. No obstetrician goes home at the end of a long day and says, “I  delivered four babies. What’s the point?”&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.newyorker.com/fiction/features/2010/06/14/100614fi_fiction_20under40_qa_david-bezmozgis&quot;&gt;David Bezmozgiz&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Since  I easily imagined that I’d never get published, I considered doing  other things. As a fallback plan, I went to film school and trained as a  film director. This was my attempt at pragmatism. I have also taught.  When things are going badly, I still consider doing  other—legitimate—things. Considering doing other—legitimate—things  sometimes feels like a second career.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div&gt;I think what I find most interesting about asking successful people about their own trajectory towards their success is how it humanizes their success. To think of someone like Jonathan Safran Foer still considering the merits of his work is really awe-inspiring and brings a level of ease to my own questioning of life-decisions, work, school, and so on.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;In relation to a profession like writing, its even more interesting to hear these successful writers, still questioning their own place in their industry. I don&#39;t think a similar question would be answered in similar ways in more socially-sanctioned professions. It is also really interesting to see the difference, (made much more apparent for me as I&#39;ve approached, transitioned into and traversed the age around when most people make their first step onto a career path) between occupations that are held in high regard or are fixated upon by the public and the kinds of decisions that are considered economically/personally/professionally viable and beneficial. The two do not meet very often, in my experience. So, although writers are often seen as important members of society, to pursue writing as a profession is hardly met with the same backing.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;In any case, you can check out the stories and Q-and-A in the piece yourself.&lt;/div&gt;

Take a look around the blog, there are some really great entries and its based in Chicago, which is reason enough to love anything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Happy birthday, President Obama.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I woke up this morning,  birthdays weren’t on my mind. On my mind was the wonderful dinner I had  with an old friend last night that left a sweet taste of memories from  college and excitement for the future. On my mind was the fact that  these are the last few weeks of my summer internship in Washington D.C.  before I head back to Chicago for graduate school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But thinking about birthdays, I can say, I’ve had some good ones in my life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2010:&lt;/strong&gt; Spent  with new friends in Beirut, Lebanon while traveling in the Middle East  as a student. Saw the sun rise over the Mediterranean and ate some of  the best kanaffeh imaginable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2009:&lt;/strong&gt; I got a  speeding ticket while driving to Columbia, Missouri to perform with my  best friends as part of a college a cappella group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2008:&lt;/strong&gt; a huge surprise party organized by my mom in my house, featuring my closest friends from college and high school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2000:&lt;/strong&gt; I had chickenpox and was cooped up in the house so my Dad snuck me out  while my mom set up a cake and some gifts (including more Calamine  lotion for the itching).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1997:&lt;/strong&gt; a pizza party at  Nirulas in New Delhi. (For those unfamiliar with late-1990’s New Delhi,  India, this place was the hot spot in town.) I felt very special as a  nine-year-old, with the entire top floor for my friends and family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1989:&lt;/strong&gt; I can’t say I remember this birthday, as it was my first, but I have  been told some great stories about my mom cooking for 200 people who  partied on a rooftop and how my dad provided liquor for everyone even  though we lived in a dry-state in India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Birthdays are tricky,  but I have learned that they’re akin to a lot of lived experience. You  have to manage expectations and also be able to draw meaning in ways  that work for you. Tracing back my birthday means more to me than just  the March 14th’s throughout the years. They’re a testament to the person  I was then, to the important people in my life which all has ultimately  helped me become who I am today.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Why I loved Inception (spoilers within)</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“&lt;/strong&gt;I think when Nolan left the labyrinth, he threw away the map.” – &lt;a href=&quot;http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20100714/REVIEWS/100719997&quot;&gt;Roger Ebert&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;em&gt;Inception&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christopher Nolan’s latest &lt;em&gt;Inception&lt;/em&gt; was released on Friday, July 16. I have been a fan of his work for a while and had been looking forward to this film as the summer hit. I hope by the time I finish this post, I will make it abundantly clear that this film did not disappoint in living up to my high expectations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were many things that impressed me about this film but I have chosen to mention just a few below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exploration of dreams and the subconscious: Christopher Nolan’s commitment to exploring this aspect of people’s subjective experience was immensely impressive. It is rumored that Nolan spent 10 years writing this script, which means he spent at least a good portion of that time analyzing his own dreaming experience. The way he captured such a surreal entity but grounded it in realism was noteworthy in itself. Nolan’s previous works, including &lt;em&gt;Batman Begins &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;The Dark Knight&lt;/em&gt; are also impressive for their ability to explore out-of-this-world concepts while still remaining grounded in realism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.slate.com/id/2260582/pagenum/all/&quot;&gt;Dana Stevens of Slate Magazine&lt;/a&gt; did not feel the same way, saying that “though Nolan is a prodigious architect of detailed dream worlds, he&#39;s too controlled and controlling a filmmaker to give himself over fully to the chaotic logic of dreams.” I would disagree with this estimation of Nolan’s interpretation on dreaming because this is what separates him from Kubric. If I wanted a disjointed, fantasy like interpretation of dreaming, I’d go re-watch &lt;em&gt;Eyes Wide Shut&lt;/em&gt;. (Nolan, while separating himself from Kubric, still &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.indiewire.com/thompsononhollywood/2010/07/05/inception_is_a_kubrickian_masterpiece_with_heart/&quot;&gt;paid homage to the director&lt;/a&gt;, which is admirable in itself)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People’s subjective construction of reality: although this is a concept that may seem absolutely basic and remedial to some, I think it bears pointing out. Nolan was adamant in creating a framework that emphasized the difference in the conscious and subconscious minds of different individuals. In the film, one of the major plot themes is the fact that Cobb’s (Leonardo DiCaprio) reality is heavily affected by his memories and troubled past with his wife (that Ariadne, whose namesake is the Greek goddess who helped Theseus escape from the Minotaur&#39;s labyrinth, helps him work through). This concept can be readily applied to our realities as individuals who inhabit an aggregated world. I think its vital to never forget that people’s realities are constructed based on their own subjective experiences, and that even a communal reality is constructed socially.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Totem concept: to separate the dream-state from consciousness, Nolan developed the concept of a Totem, an object that only the dreamer is familiar with and that can be used to verify the end of a dream and the beginning of reality. I thought this was a clever device used by Nolan that has some grounding in recent neuro-scientific research. Known within psychology as &lt;a href=&quot;http://scienceblogs.com/neurophilosophy/2010/06/touch_influences_social_judgements_and_decisions.php?utm_source=feedburner&amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+scienceblogs%2FYsBw+%28Neurophilosophy%29&quot;&gt;embodied cognition&lt;/a&gt;, this concept basically claims that our sensual experience of touching and feeling has an effect on our judgment and decision making processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last shot of the movie involves the totem concept, and leaves the viewer questioning whether Cobb was still dreaming or had finally concurred his subconscious and made it back home in reality. Some have said that Cobb was still dreaming because the top did not fall, while some have cursed Nolan for not answering the question more directly. In my opinion, I think Cobb had successfully made it to reality and the reason Nolan left the question unanswered was to make the point that our realities and dreams are not as bifurcated as we would imagine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all, after 2 viewings, I am still finding myself thinking about some of the concepts in the film. I would not go as far as to say it is Nolan’s best work, but I certainly think it lived up to and surpassed the expectations I had for it. I’m happy to be experiencing Nolan’s rise to one of the best film-makers of our time first hand.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>On Transitions</title>
   <link href="/general/music/washington%20dc/2010/06/05/on-transitions/"/>
   <updated>2010-06-05T16:25:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>/general/music/washington%20dc/2010/06/05/on-transitions</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I was listening to this week’s episode of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thisamericanlife.org/&quot;&gt;This American Life&lt;/a&gt;, on the topic of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/102/road-trip?bypass=true&quot;&gt;Road-trips&lt;/a&gt; (a &lt;a href=&quot;http://samarthbhaskar.wordpress.com/2010/01/05/on-travel/&quot;&gt;topic after my own heart&lt;/a&gt;), and it brought me to some thoughts that I’ve been having for a while, but could not exactly verbalize until hearing what some of the contributors to this week’s show had to say. All of the whirlwind changes I’ve been having the last few months really put me front and center into processes of transition that paralleled some of the most important transitions I have ever made in my life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transitioning to DC has been relatively successful for me so far. I started working for a new company, have a new place to live and a whole new city and surroundings to explore. I am very impressed with DC thus far. It has a sense of pride all its own and a character that I cannot yet describe but can certainly identify.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think transitions are interesting because they include a sense of reflecting on the past and hopefulness for the future. Bringing in the connection to This American Life, one of the contributors this week mentioned that he felt like taking road-trips presented an opportunity for change and growth and epiphanies, etc. And Ira Glass responded by capturing in a few words what road-trips, and in a larger context transitions, encompass -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“  . . . [w]hat a road trip stands for is hope, hope, that somewhere, anywhere is better than here. Somewhere on the road I’ll turn into the person I want to be, I could to be, the person I am.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was on a run while listening to this, and I found myself boosted with a sense of newfound energy because what he had just said captured exactly what I have been feeling recently. I think this transition to DC, to a new company and to a new chapter in my life is another chance for me to develop the person I will be in the future. That may sound really obvious, but I find it to be an important thing to take into consideration at the beginning of a new endeavor, and to remind myself of throughout the endeavor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have also been using the Metro system a lot, to commute to work, to make my way around the city and because I love public transportation on its own merit. While on the metro I have been consuming a lot of great media, so I think I’d like to share some of the highlights in case any readers are interested. Here are a few top picks from this last week –&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/102/road-trip?bypass=true&quot;&gt;This American Life – Road Trips&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wnyc.org/shows/radiolab/&quot;&gt;Radiolab&lt;/a&gt; – &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.wnyc.org/radiolab/2010/05/17/famous-tumors/&quot;&gt;Famous Tumors&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.wnyc.org/radiolab/2010/06/01/deception-rebroadcast/&quot;&gt;Deception&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://castroller.com/podcasts/TheMothPodcast/1507946-Starlee%20Kine%20Radical%20Honesty&quot;&gt;Starley Kine’s Moth Podcast appearance&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contra_%28album%29&quot;&gt;Vampire Weekend&#39;s Contra&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wild_Hunt_%28album%29&quot;&gt;The Tallest Man on Earth’s The Wild Hunt&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subiza&quot;&gt;Delorean’s Subiza&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ll probably start making a habit of putting up some highlights of what I&#39;ve been listening to throughout this summer. A couple of hours a day on the Metro can really make great time for listening, absorbing and thinking.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>To New Beginnings</title>
   <link href="/2010/05/21/to-new-beginnings/"/>
   <updated>2010-05-21T20:37:59-04:00</updated>
   <id>/2010/05/21/to-new-beginnings</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;After writing my last post about looking forward to many different new adventures coming up shortly for me, I suppose it would only be appropriate to start the newest of these adventures off with a post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Monday I will be starting my summer internship with &lt;a href=&quot;gqrr.com&quot;&gt;Greenberg Quinlan Rosner Research&lt;/a&gt; in Washington D.C. Although I have yet to be introduced to my co-workers and the office, I am really looking forward to working in a dynamic and progressive office during midterm season. I foresee my time there going by very fast, but I also hope to get some valuable insights into an industry that I have been training myself for, for quite some time now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will be living with a family friend in &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bethesda,_Maryland&quot;&gt;Bethesda, MD&lt;/a&gt; and commuting into metro DC for work every day. Besides the work itself, which will obviously be occupying most of my time, I am excited to spend evenings and weekends exploring the city of Washington DC and the surrounding areas. I also hope to do a little traveling around the East Coast, time and money permitting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although I am clearly excited to be spending the summer in DC with a great new professional opportunity, there is a part of me that will miss home more than I realized I would. Perhaps because I was more than &lt;a href=&quot;http://samarthbhaskar.wordpress.com/2010/01/02/study-abroad-in-dubai-uae/&quot;&gt;ready to leave for Dubai&lt;/a&gt; in January, perhaps because this new adventures comes at the heels of another incredible one or perhaps because I found new reasons to like Bloomington, whatever the reason, there is a part of me that will miss Bloomington more this time around. In all honesty, I never thought I would be saying that. But as I have learned throughout this year – never say never.  At the end of the day, this makes me realize once again, that beginnings do not require new locations, new adventures, leaving home or any of these things, they can happen at any time if you are willing to let them.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Some thoughts on endings</title>
   <link href="/dubai/2010/05/03/some-thoughts-endings/"/>
   <updated>2010-05-03T18:02:01-04:00</updated>
   <id>/dubai/2010/05/03/some-thoughts-endings</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I recently finished my semester in Dubai, and returned home to Bloomington-Normal, Illinois. I have had some time to reflect on my semester abroad, all of my wonderful experiences, finishing my undergraduate career and endings, in general.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the last week or so of my time in Dubai, a lot of my friends (in Dubai and here at home) asked me in one form or another if I was sad about ending my time abroad and going back home. My gut instinct, and how I truly feel, was that I really was not sad at all, but I was asked so many times that I eventually had to come up with reasons why I wasn’t sad. I ultimately figured out that it was because I have a lot of really exciting things coming up in my future, not the least of which is the graduate program I will be entering into this fall at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://mapss.uchicago.edu/why_mapss/individualized_programs.shtml#&quot;&gt;University of Chicago&lt;/a&gt;. That helped bring some excitement to the prospect of ending an otherwise amazing experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to what is to come, I also couldn’t get myself to be sad about my time in Dubai ending because I had such an amazing experience. I know common logic would say that if I enjoyed everything so much, shouldn’t I be sad that there is no possibility of more such amazing things happening, on account of my time there ending. Although that is certainly true, I am more interested in reflecting positively on time well-spent than ruminating on what could have been.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My time in Dubai is not the only important “ending” that has been on my mind as of late. I will also be graduating from the University of Illinois in a couple of weeks. Traditionally, the graduation ceremonies are called commencement ceremonies, and that is how I prefer to think of them. Starting a graduate program after graduation, moving to a new city and looking forward to new adventures is really the proper way to cap up my time at U of I. I think it is the best way for me to pay homage to all the people and organizations that have had a profound impact on my time spent as an undergraduate there. All the enriching experiences I have had as an undergraduate have shaped what is to come for me in the future and my future is the best way for me to make the most of my past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I stumbled upon a bag of cards while cleaning my room yesterday. It happened to be full of cards I received when I graduated high school in 2006. Most of them reminded me how close I was with my friends in high school; I was truly blessed in that sense. And then I happened to open a card from a friend who passed away last winter in a car crash and it suddenly sobered all of these elated emotions I’ve been feeling. Seeing his message, reading his hand-writing and seeing his name really put all of these experiences into perspective. I truly believe that the impermanence of life is what makes it so valuable. As in the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0140449191?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=slatmaga-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0140449191&quot;&gt;Epic of Gilgamesh&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; when the Goddess Siduri tells the protagonist this is it, we only get one life (after he has harrowed many adventures to reach heaven and ask about the true meaning of life). She says &quot;love the child who holds you by the hand, and give your wife pleasure in your embrace,&quot; I hope to embrace the past that I have been given and work for the future that I am not guaranteed.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>My Love for Culinary Tourism</title>
   <link href="/dubai/middle%20east/2010/04/20/my-love-for-culinary-tourism/"/>
   <updated>2010-04-20T18:15:38-04:00</updated>
   <id>/dubai/middle%20east/2010/04/20/my-love-for-culinary-tourism</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I have been fortunate enough to do a bit of traveling during my semester here in Dubai. All of my trips have had one tying theme, which was partly unintended but mostly a conscious decision for me – and that has been eating. I have realized that, as of now, &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culinary_tourism&quot;&gt;culinary or food tourism&lt;/a&gt; is my favorite way to engage with a new place. Below are some of my favorite eating experiences from the past few months in the region. Not all were as amazing as the rest, not all have as special a place in my heart, but all have contributed to some of the best experiences of recent memory for me and colored my time in the Middle East in its own unique way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Dubai – Ravi Restaurant, Karachi Darbar, Antar Cafeteria, Bombay Star Juice Bar&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have some really great memories attached to food experiences here in Dubai. It’s a city for food-lovers. Since I’m on a student budget, I couldn’t really explore the high class, gourmet food scene, but I definitely tried my best to cover all the local cheap eateries and they did not disappoint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ravi/Karachi/&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luiRIm9HESo&quot;&gt;Bombay Juice bar&lt;/a&gt; made for some of the best North Indian/Pakistani food I have had in my life and that is including India itself. The owners of these places know my friends and me by face and order by now and can probably thank us for putting their kids through college. Shahi paneer, butter naans, butter chicken and mango lassis were some of the staples, but I can honestly say there is not a bad dish on any of these menus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Oman – Yemeni Mandi, Roadside Biryani&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first foray outside the UAE in early March was a weekend stint in Muscat, Oman. After a beautiful day of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4Uj6VqIkF8&quot;&gt;hiking, swimming and rock climbing at Wadi Shab&lt;/a&gt;, we stopped by a gas station and there were a couple of restaurants attached. I was famished and went into a small café and ordered large quantities of Biryani. After hours of hiking on an empty stomach anything would have tasted good, but this Biryani was amazing on its own accord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later that weekend I was fortunate enough to spend an evening with some really cool people over Yemeni Mandi. It was my first experience and my best. Sitting on the floor around huge platters of rice, meat, chicken, yogurt, bread and sauces, eating with our hands and indulging in some great globally minded conversation made for a terrific experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Lebanon – homemade Kibbeh, Seaside 4-course sea-food, &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanafeh&quot;&gt;Kanafah&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lebanon featured some amazing homemade Kibbeh from the amazing family that hosted us for a few days in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ou9JNeABrmg&quot;&gt;Zgharta&lt;/a&gt;. After we made our way down to Beirut and the South, the food experiences really took off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Tyr (Sur in Arabic) I ate what was arguably the most amazing meal of my time in the region. It consisted of 5 courses of amazing Arabic sea-food. To try and explain everything involved would be doing complete injustice to the environment, tastes, company and overall atmosphere of the occasion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later that week, on our last night after going out in one of the best party cities in the world, I was treated to some of the best Kanafeh I’ve ever had while watching the sun come up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Bahrain – Chicken Tikka, &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandi_(food)&quot;&gt;Mandi&lt;/a&gt;, Chocolate Special K cereal, chai&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bahrain again made for some delicious food tourism, although one of the coolest parts was a box of cereal at my host’s apartment. I &lt;a href=&quot;www.couchsurfing.org&quot;&gt;couch-surfed&lt;/a&gt; in Manama, and one of my hosts was in the American Navy and he had a box of Chocolate Special K in his apartment. I found myself slowly eating through the entire box while watching trash American TV. It was a nice way to feel American for a bit, and it totally brought me back to my days of cereal eating in college and at home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also got to eat some amazing &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxbDy89-82M&quot;&gt;tandoor bread, chicken tikka &lt;/a&gt;in a nice park at sunset with some great new (and old) friends, and shared Mandi over some more amazing conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Kuwait – street shawarma, kebabs, Indo-Chinese, Tandoori chicken, home-cooked meals&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kuwait may have been the most all-inclusive food touristic experience of all. Pretty much all I did in Kuwait was eat, and it was terrific. Starting with shawarma  from a street-side restaurant in downtown &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsNTkf84Zvo&quot;&gt;Kuwait City&lt;/a&gt;, to a kilo of Kebabs, to Indo-Chinese Szechuan inspired cooking, to more amazing tandoori chicken, I can honestly say I ate more in 3 days in Kuwait, than I usually do in a week in Dubai.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I stayed with some family friends so I was also treated to some amazing home cooked Indian meals, including some of the best and most satisfying Biryani I have had.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Food and culinary practices are obviously part and parcel of a culture. Getting to travel was a great opportunity in itself, but coupled with these food experiences, it made for some very memorable times. I will say that my favorite part about all of these experiences was being able to share them with the friends I have made over the course of this semester. Some of these people I may have known before, but got to know better, and others I met for a short while but they added tremendously to my time in the Middle East.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am excited to apply these same practices and principles to places in the US as I move forward. My appetite, as it seems, knows no bounds. The inevitable food-babies await my food-parenting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ps: I would advise against blogging about food while hungry.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>The possibility of Arab Occidentalism</title>
   <link href="/international%20relations/middle%20east/talks/2010/04/12/the-possibility-of-arab-occidentalism/"/>
   <updated>2010-04-12T10:57:12-04:00</updated>
   <id>/international%20relations/middle%20east/talks/2010/04/12/the-possibility-of-arab-occidentalism</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In one of my classes this semester, Arabic Literature, we are studying a few pieces from an anthology of Arab travel literature, called &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/America-Arab-Mirror-Literature-Anthology/dp/0312229631&quot;&gt;America in an Arab Mirror&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, The collection tracks back depictions of America and the West by Arab writers including poetry, prose, short stories and other works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had an interesting discussion about the concept of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Power-Knowledge-Selected-Interviews-1972-1977/dp/039473954X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;qid=1271090952&amp;amp;sr=1-1&quot;&gt;knowledge and power&lt;/a&gt;, and more specifically the constructs developed by Edward Said in his famous work &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Orientalism-Western-Conceptions-Penguin-Classics/dp/0141187425/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;qid=1271091048&amp;amp;sr=1-1&quot;&gt;Orientalism&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. For those unfamiliar, a short summary of Said’s work would suggest that Western scholarship on the Orient (Middle East, Far East, etc) is not an innocent scholarly look into another part of the world. He suggests it is a scholarship laden with power relationships performed through a vantage of power, making the East an exotic entity, and not objective but hand-in-glove with power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This brought up the question of whether this kind of scholarship can turn the microscope back onto the West, and whether there is the possibility of an Arab Occidentalism.  In my opinion, Arab Occidentalism is unavoidable because of the points of contact between these two regions (the West and the Arab world). Even in a pre-9/11 world, these two regions have been in contact over economic, security, geopolitical and religious reasons. And of course since 9/11, the points of contact have been ever more apparent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two main schools of thought that exist within the study of Arab Occidentalism suggest that Arab’s view of the West is either informed by deep-rooted cultural, religious or historical beliefs or by American foreign-policy within the Arab world. However, I think a third category must be added to this list: Arab travelers within the West who write about the West from the inside, the most contemporary such writer being &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sayyid_Qutb&quot;&gt;Sayyid Qutb&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first glance, it is easy to say that Western Orientalism is far more consequential than Arab Occidentalism. Western Orientalist writers are often part and parcel with policy-makers, either by working in policy spheres themselves or heavily influencing the ways in which policy is formed. On the contrary, one would be hard-pressed to find Arab Occidentalist writers within similar arenas in the Arab world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I think it is important to consider Arab Occidental writing as it shapes Arab views of the West because these are the very views that groups in the Arab world play off of to promote their chosen image of the West. Taking again the example of Sayyid Qutb, in his work “The America That I Have Seen,” and &lt;em&gt;Milestones&lt;/em&gt; Qutb clearly sets up an image of America that informs the ideology of groups like the Muslim Brotherhood, Al Qaeda and Islamic Jihad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is easy to brush off Arab writings about the West because they are similarly essentialist as Western Orientalism yet lack the institutional power that Orientalism is associated with it, but I think we would be well-advised to still consider these works as they inform the larger conversation about the West in the Arab world.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>A Response to “Online Status Anxiety”</title>
   <link href="/media%20studies/technology/2010/03/29/a-response-to-%25e2%2580%259conline-status-anxiety%25e2%2580%259d/"/>
   <updated>2010-03-29T13:27:16-04:00</updated>
   <id>/media%20studies/technology/2010/03/29/a-response-to-%e2%80%9conline-status-anxiety%e2%80%9d</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A couple of weeks ago Jonah Lehrer published an entry on his blog, “The Frontal Cortex” &lt;a href=&quot;http://scienceblogs.com/cortex/2010/03/online_status_anxiety.php&quot;&gt;his take on social networking&lt;/a&gt; on Web 2.0. I have finally gotten around to writing an entry on the matter, since a couple of things struck me in Lehrer’s discussion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. “Social software tend to quantify our social life” – this is not exactly an emerging feature of social networks, as Lehrer proposes. Having a list of “friends” or contacts and displaying some way in which the members of these lists are related to each other is a required feature to qualify a tool as a social software or social network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://jcmc.indiana.edu/vol13/issue1/boyd.ellison.html&quot;&gt;earliest definitions of social network sites&lt;/a&gt; (SNS) include 3 mean features. (1) Constructing a public or semi-public profile in a bounded system (2) articulating &lt;strong&gt;a list of others &lt;/strong&gt;with whom you share a connection and (3) &lt;strong&gt;ability to view and traverse a list&lt;/strong&gt; of these connections and those made by others in the system. So the fact that as we are maturing through the timeline of SNSs a few services are becoming more popular than others is not a factor of or has not resulted in the quantification of connections online. SNSs by definition require this quantification in some form or another. [I know this is a cheap shot at Lehrer’s piece, but I thought it needed clarification].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. “My worry is that our online social platforms both magnify our hierarchies (by measuring our friends, followers, links, etc.) and erase social distance, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.disambiguity.com/ambient-intimacy/&quot;&gt;[read: Ambient Intimacy]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; so that we suddenly find ourselves in the same monkey cage with a far larger number of monkeys”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**bold and hyperlink added**&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Staying true to his great ability to articulate complex issues and bring in great thinkers, Lehrer ties in one of my favorite Primatologists &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Sapolsky&quot;&gt;Robert Sapolsky&lt;/a&gt; (this &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrCVu25wQ5s&quot;&gt;speech&lt;/a&gt; by him comes highly recommended) and one of my favorite philosophers (and LOST namesake) David Hume to argue that because if collapsed space we are more aware of social hierarchies and what’s more is that SNSs enhance social hierarchies by quantifying our social networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although I can’t say I’ve never envied someone for an impressive and extensive social network prowess, I don’t necessarily think this is the only outcome of increased use of SNSs. In fact, I think this is one, albeit dystopian, result of SNSs. They can create anxiety among people, they can lead to a heightened awareness of our own social position and they can possibly create a new set of problems for us as social beings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I’m more inclined to believe that these problems are not unique to online SNSs or digitally mediated social interaction. As such, these are human concerns and obstacles that we have faced before and will continue to face as long as our nature stays on a similar socially-oriented path as it has. I recognize the point that Lehrer is making, which is that bringing in a new way to socialize (namely, online) brings a new set of problems for us to deal with. But I am more interested to see the  many new ways to exercise our social nature, to create new concepts like ambient intimacy and to further communication, which in my opinion is a fundamental human characteristic and desire. We have been faced with challenges through changing societies, environments, communities and technologies but we have succeeded (with a few exceptions) in finding use in these challenges and sometimes even altering the course of our progress through them.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Small Campus Experience</title>
   <link href="/general/2010/03/26/small-campus-experience/"/>
   <updated>2010-03-26T13:51:40-04:00</updated>
   <id>/general/2010/03/26/small-campus-experience</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;One of the differences in my experience this semester at &lt;a href=&quot;aud.edu&quot;&gt;AUD&lt;/a&gt; has been something that is not necessarily tied to the culture or location of Dubai, but more to the differences in the size of AUD and the &lt;a href=&quot;illinois.edu&quot;&gt;University of Illinois&lt;/a&gt;. AUD is a rather small university with a small campus. Compared to the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, my home institution, AUD could fit completely in of the small quadrangle areas at UIUC. Class sizes here are small (6-30 in my classes), there are not very many academic buildings, libraries or student facilities and the relationships between professors and their students is noticeably different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This carries with it some inherent differences, when compared to the collegiate experience I have had thus far at U of I. Being one of 40,000 plus students at UIUC really requires you to make your own place or run the risk of being swallowed up in the sea of faces and names. Here at AUD it’s pretty easy after a week of walking around campus to start recognizing faces (and beyond that, get involved in people’s gossip, a la high school).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been working with various members of the faculty and staff here at AUD pretty regularly throughout the semester to gain access to some of the media facilities located near my campus (mainly MBC and Al-Arabiyya) and they have been really helpful and accessible. Although it certainly took the initial impetus from my end, the ease of accessing these professionals and getting the ball rolling on this project was pretty remarkable. At UIUC on the other hand, without a great deal of courage and confidence (or even mere awareness) it is pretty easy to float by and find yourself on the graduation stage receiving your diploma.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t mean to attach any value judgments to these differences, just to point out the different experience I’m having at a small school versus the one I’ve had for the last 3 and a half years at a big school. If it weren’t for my personal goals and motivations, I don’t think I would have gained as much as I did from my time at UIUC. On the other hand, there is a limited amount of things &lt;em&gt;to&lt;/em&gt; gain here at AUD, given its small size and scope and overall lack of development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many more differences I could point out between these two experiences, but ultimately what is important is that these things would have been valuable to know in high school when I was deciding about college. I think I had the best experience I could have at UIUC and it was the best choice for me, but perhaps it just happened to work out that way. I think there’s also some importance in the idea of being prepared for life after college. The immersive experience that U of I can offer (often referred to as the U of I bubble) can really be distracting for the 3-5 years that most spend there as undergrads. As with everything this has its positives and negatives. It allows you to feel like you can concentrate on being a college student and gain a ton from all the experiences you’re having, but then it also brings with it a tough reality check when it is time to leave. I would just advise those with still some time left to continue to enjoy the immersion, but also keep the reality of graduation in the back of your heads. And to those who are ready to graduate: I think we can rest happily knowing we gained a lot from our immersion the last 3-5 years, and now we can move on to another community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will now be dismounting from my soapbox.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;But not before asking for your thoughts on the matter, so do share if you care to.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Middle Eastern Millennials Survey</title>
   <link href="/middle%20east/technology/2010/03/19/middle-eastern-millennials-survey/"/>
   <updated>2010-03-19T11:39:42-04:00</updated>
   <id>/middle%20east/technology/2010/03/19/middle-eastern-millennials-survey</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A recent &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.arabyouthsurvey.com/highlights.html&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; released by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.asdaa.com/&quot;&gt;ASDAA Burston-Marsteller&lt;/a&gt;, a leading Middle Eastern Public Relation consultancy chronicles the demographics, behaviors and attitudes of young residents of the Middle East, across 9 countries. This survey is the largest and most comprehensive of its kind in recent Middle Eastern history and provides some useful insights. This kind of information is an important insight into one of the most important segments of the Middle Eastern population. The Middle East is a very young region, by and large, and with its interesting mix between abundance of certain resources and dearth of others, provides an intriguing set of questions and concerns as we move forward into the coming decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the most interesting points, for me, are mentioned below –&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. The single most important priority for young people in the Middle East is living in a democratic country, followed by having quality infrastructure, and access to the best universities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. The rising cost of living, shortage of affordable housing, and unemployment are the top three worries for Arab youth&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. Despite the rapid acceptance by young Arabs of the digital age, nearly half of all those surveyed read a newspaper every day&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4. Two-thirds of Arab youth spend their leisure time in front of the TV&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5. Many young people’s spending habits are leaving them in debt&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6. The growing economic significance of the East, specifically China and India, appears to be influencing the way in which Arab youth regard the international community&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7. Today’s Arab youth consider themselves as true citizens of the world&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;8. Youth in the Middle East are evenly split on their preference to work in the government or private sector&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am particularly interested to see the reactions reported related to mainstream media use versus social networking use, given the attachment that young Middle-Easterners have to their mobile devices. I wonder if the future of communication in the Middle East is headed toward a different trajectory than it is in the West. It will be interesting to see how Middle Eastern youth embrace new media in ways that work for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>5 Days in Lebanon</title>
   <link href="/middle%20east/2010/03/16/5-days-in-lebanon/"/>
   <updated>2010-03-16T06:46:12-04:00</updated>
   <id>/middle%20east/2010/03/16/5-days-in-lebanon</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;blockquote&gt;“&lt;em&gt;Didn’t have my camera by my side this time; hoping I would see the world with both my eyes;  Maybe I will tell you all about it when I’m in the mood to lose my way with words.” – &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaA7b9UTX7U&quot;&gt;John Mayer, 3x5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week I took a trip to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/le.html&quot;&gt;Lebanon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/le.html&quot;&gt; &lt;/a&gt;for 5 days. We landed in Beirut on the 9&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; and flew out on the 14&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;. This was the first time I have taken a trip like this without really anything planned at all. I barely knew where I’d be staying, what I’d be doing or anything beyond the fact that I’d be landing in Beirut at 11:40am on March 9&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;. Below is what ensued and amounted to one of the best trips of my life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. We were picked up by my friend Grace’s &lt;em&gt;distant&lt;/em&gt; family who are residents of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zgharta&quot;&gt;Zgharta&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zgharta&quot;&gt; &lt;/a&gt;which is a town located in the North of Lebanon. What we soon found out was that Zghurta is known for a couple of things: their &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kibbeh&quot;&gt;kibbeh&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kibbeh&quot;&gt; &lt;/a&gt;and their love affair with their guns. The town is one of the strong-holds of Northern Maronite Lebanon. It is located about 15 minutes away from &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tripoli,_Lebanon&quot;&gt;Tripoli&lt;/a&gt; and is one of the most &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.habeeb.com/images/lebanon.photos/Zghorta-ehden-zgharta/Zgharta-ehden.138.jpg&quot;&gt;picaresque&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.habeeb.com/images/lebanon.photos/Zghorta-ehden-zgharta/Zgharta-ehden.138.jpg&quot;&gt; &lt;/a&gt;places I have visited. About 15 minutes drive away is the beach and 15 minutes in the direction takes you 1600 meters above sea-level to &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ehden&quot;&gt;Ehden&lt;/a&gt;, Lebanon which somehow managed to be even more picaresque than Zgharta. Near Ehden was where &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ou9JNeABrmg&quot;&gt;we visited a couple of the most beautiful churches&lt;/a&gt; and monasteries I have seen. We were invited in by a monk at one of the monasteries for wine, sweets and coffee. It was a terrific experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Living with a Lebanese family was a terrific, and truly once in a lifetime experience. They spoke Arabic all day long, so I was able to really polish up on my Arabic quite a bit and learn a lot of different words and phrases in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebanese_Arabic&quot;&gt;Lebanese dialect&lt;/a&gt;. Their hospitality was also beyond belief. Everyone there treated us like a part of their own family, actually even better than a member of their own family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. On Friday we returned closer to Beirut and met with the External Relations Manager at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.aust.edu.lb/&quot;&gt;American University of Technology&lt;/a&gt; in Jbeil, near Beirut. Marcel was a fascinating guy. He met my friend Sarah’s mom at a conference in the U.S. last year and exchanged contact information. Sarah had contacted him via e-mail and he was gracious enough to invite us to his office while we were in Lebanon. Once we got a tour of AUT, Marcel was gracious enough to take the rest of the day off to drive us around &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byblos&quot;&gt;Byblos&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byblos&quot;&gt; &lt;/a&gt;and Jbeil. He even bought us &lt;a href=&quot;http://almashriq.hiof.no/lebanon/500/550/551/abisaad/&quot;&gt;300 million year old fossils&lt;/a&gt;. Marcel was a very intelligent and candid source of insight about Lebanese political, civil and social life. He also offered to set up prestigious internships for Grace and Sarah with the likes of the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.un.org/&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:normal;&quot;&gt;UN&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.undp.org/&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:normal;&quot;&gt;UNDP &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;and other very impressive NGOs in Lebanon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. Then we met up with some other friends in Beirut near the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.aub.edu.lb/&quot;&gt;American University of Beirut&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;By a pretty extraordinary turn of events my friend Grace’s Arabic class from back in Alabama were pretty much all in Beirut the same weekend, including their teacher who is a resident of Beirut, so we spent a couple of days with them. Our hosts were so gracious as to take us on a tour of South Lebanon (to Saida and Tyr) where we ate a delicious 4 course sea food meal, saw beautiful towns and country side along the coast and met some really wonderful people. After returning to Beirut we got to check out the famous Beirut nightlife, and in my opinion, it was in contention with Las Vegas as some of the best nightlife I’ve gotten to partake in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4. On our last full day, we met up with yet another friend. Grace (she was coincidently named that, so I will refer to her as Lebanese Grace from now) was yet another amazing host, which fit rather appropriately into the theme of the week. She showed us around Downtown Beirut and other amazing parts of the city. We then parted ways with her for a couple of hours, during which I was surprised by my friends for my birthday. They got me 2 delicious chocolate cakes and some delicious chocolate &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tasteofbeirut.com/2009/09/booza-haleeb-ma-fustok-milk-ice-cream-with-sahlab-pistachios/&quot;&gt;booza&lt;/a&gt;, needless to say, I was a happy birthday boy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We later went to sing karaoke and then to another nightclub with Lebanese Grace and her friends from AUB and LAU. Sparing a few details, we ended up eating, driving and hanging out with some of the nicest and most genuine people the entire night, until 10am the next morning when we were driven to the airport to catch our flight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If it isn’t clear by my tone in this post, I truly had a trip of a lifetime. Everyone we met, all the things we got to do all came together to create a beautiful picture of an already beautiful country. Lebanon has a storied colonial, post-colonial, confessional, political and international history but to spend time gaining an appreciation for the people and places that have hosted these histories was really what made this trip a once in a lifetime opportunity. I am glad to have made so many new friends that there really is no reason for me not to go back and visit again someday, and I certainly hope I will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh – and my camera was broken, so no pictures. Trust me, I’m more upset about it than you’d imagine. But hopefully I’ll get it fixed soon.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Dubai, Abu-Dhabi and the UAE</title>
   <link href="/dubai/international%20relations/middle%20east/politics/2010/03/01/dubai-abu-dhabi-and-the-uae/"/>
   <updated>2010-03-01T09:18:20-05:00</updated>
   <id>/dubai/international%20relations/middle%20east/politics/2010/03/01/dubai-abu-dhabi-and-the-uae</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Last weekend I visited &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abu_Dhabi&quot;&gt;Abu-Dhabi&lt;/a&gt;. It was about a 2 hour bus-ride from Dubai and only 20 AED (about $6 USD). It was a nice opportunity to get outside of Dubai and check out another part of the UAE. Abu-Dhabi, the city,  is the capitol of the United Arab Emirates and the emirate of the same name is the largest emirate in the federation. Below are some interesting facts about Abu-Dhabi, Dubai, the relationship between these cities and the UAE in general.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abu-Dhabi&lt;/strong&gt;: As I could notice while I was there, Abu-Dhabi seems far less developed than Dubai. Without &lt;a href=&quot;http://samarthbhaskar.wordpress.com/2010/01/11/first-impressions-of-dubai/&quot;&gt;describing more how glamorous Dubai is&lt;/a&gt;, suffice it to say that Abu-Dhabi was not nearly as glamorous. I walked around Corniche Road, which is the main tourist area including the beach front, saw some parts of the business and downtown district and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheikh_Zayed_Mosque&quot;&gt;Grand Mosque&lt;/a&gt; (which as it turns out is the World’s third largest mosque, with number 1 and 2 being in Mecca and Medina in Saudi Arabia).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although Abu-Dhabi seemed less over-the-top than Dubai, it in fact is home to more than 90% of the country’s oil revenues. It is by far the richest city and emirate, so much so that it provides a majority of the budget-needs of some of the smaller emirates. Culturally, Abu-Dhabi has tried for a long time to keep a distant relationship between itself and Dubai. According to Davidson (citation below), Abu-Dhabi has always had a tremendous amount of stability because of its oil revenues (let’s just say that certain estimates put per capita GDP in Abu-Dhabi near $275,000). This has allowed Abu-Dhabi to continue a steady sense of growth, instead of taking the risks that Dubai has taken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dubai:&lt;/strong&gt; As a city and an emirate, Dubai has taken some incredible risks in its history. From opening up&lt;a href=&quot;http://sso.dubaitrade.ae/sso/jsp/custom/login-ex.jsp?site2pstoretoken=v1.4~88EA867F~C0DB3FC9C5B06BBE55E5A5F23CC7C533B8D17905BBB370554A858C1E760A4EDBBBF6900982FB680AC0FAC7FAFF44EBD352588E048B4962AE2AFA0F6051CECE2C32FB2D8A43C76F2F3957F597AA4A1D9F81A8033B551CF8F9DC6966C6983D11234C3FA5F436840A3EA3BC3BAFAA2426C86BFCBD5B352852662B46BF47E555EB4E8398ED2AB3FA0F4F5F44AC2F37DEA494D6BC41355BA92603F439309FD5DE12BAAEC4C231D4F500A20D8B29AA0C1D0F2F2DBFD319C4F016499273152B1335B806&amp;amp;p_error_code=&amp;amp;p_submit_url=http://sso.dubaitrade.ae/sso/auth&amp;amp;p_cancel_url=http://pilot.dubaitrade.ae:80&amp;amp;ssousername=&quot;&gt; ports and free zones &lt;/a&gt;for foreign investment to investing heavily in the tourism industry to antagonizing its cultural partners in other emirates and Gulf states in order to please expatriates, Dubai has seen a dynamic development to reach where it is today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Between Dubai and Abu-Dhabi:&lt;/strong&gt; Essentially, these are the two emirates of 7 in UAE that really matter the most. Dubai is the social, financial and international capitol and Abu-Dhabi the economic, financial and cultural capitol (although the culture point is arguable, because Dubai has a culture of its own). Although Dubai and UAE have been at odds over many issues at times, they are at the end of the day, still very closely related and will continually come to each other’s aid in times of need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UAE as a model is fascinating because although it is a federation each emirate really has a great deal of autonomy, and even as a federation only one emirate (ruling family in essence) controls the majority of legislation, policy, finance, etc.  I’d highly recommend looking up the Davidson article, as well as some of his other works, if you find yourself interested in learning more about UAE.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>What do Tehran and “Precious” have in common?</title>
   <link href="/middle%20east/movies/2010/02/19/what-do-tehran-and-%25e2%2580%259cprecious%25e2%2580%259d-have-in-common/"/>

   <id>/middle%20east/movies/2010/02/19/what-do-tehran-and-%e2%80%9cprecious%e2%80%9d-have-in-common</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I came back home after class in the afternoon and my roommate was watching “&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0929632/&quot;&gt;Precious&lt;/a&gt;,” the 2009 &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0200005/&quot;&gt;Lee Daniels&lt;/a&gt; film starring Gabourey Sidibe and Mo’Nique. “Precious” or the full title “Precious: Based on the Novel Push by Sapphire” is the story of a young girl in Harlem subjected to terrible tortures by her mother and her mother’s boyfriend, lost in the education system, becoming a mother herself and having been all but given up on by everyone. Daniels paints one of the bleakest pictures every captured on film, and moves it along very painstakingly by letting the audience hang on to the slightest sense of hope for Precious. For those who have yet to see the film, I highly recommend it but you should know full and well what you’re getting yourself into, it will likely weigh heavy on your mind for a while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After my roommate finished watching the film, we struck up a conversation about how powerful the film really was. Throughout the conversation he mentioned some really intriguing things. He mentioned that the movie had a really personal effect on him. He recalled many of his cousins and friends whom he has lost to crystal meth and other drugs, back in Tehran. He equated Tehran to the scene in the film when the social worker comes to Mary’s (Mo’Nique) apartment for a home visit. He said Tehran was a lot like the family who put on a face for the social worker, to make everything seem comfortable and put-together, only to go right back to their destitute ways when the world stopped looking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My roommate (whose name I am consciously omitting) said that he had a hard time getting through the film because it hit home for him in so many ways. And that really struck me. A film made about Harlem, &lt;a href=&quot;http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20091104/REVIEWS/911059999&quot;&gt;about the African American experience in modern day United States&lt;/a&gt;, about social neglect of a systemic problem, about forgotten individuals ended up evoking empathy from someone from another part of the world. My roommate went on to tell me about rampant drug and sex abuse in Tehran, about the ways in which the social fabric of the city has been falling apart recently. He mentioned stories about police officers watching as people were being beaten on the streets because criminals aren’t worth their time, about drug dealing and drug abuse among high school students and sex workers around the city. For an Islamic Republic with reputedly state control over so many facets of life, some of the stories he mentioned were truly shocking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was fascinating to talk to him about the impact of films in his life, because they’ve been such an important part of my life. There were a lot of reasons I loved “Precious” when I first saw it but this certainly adds to its prestige, as far as I’m concerned. A film that can so truly plug into humanity by discussing, in the most honest of ways, some of the worst parts of humanity certainly achieves some of the intended (and unintended) purposes of culture and art and furthers humanity itself. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <id>/dubai/middle%20east/talks/2010/02/12/business-law-in-the-uae</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A couple of days ago I attended a lecture on campus on business law in the UAE. It was an interesting, albeit visceral, look at the way commercial transactions law works in the UAE. As I am largely unfamiliar with business law on the whole so I can’t exactly compare it to anything else, but it was interesting in and of itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below are some of the main take-home points I took from the lecture:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Civil vs Common Law&lt;/strong&gt;: UAE has a civil law system which, unlike common law, is not based on judicial precedent. So a judge’s decision is not binding for all following judges, but because of the way the judicial system is set up, senior judges most often abide by certain principles which bring cohesion to the system of law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Different types of companies&lt;/strong&gt;: UAE law outlines 7 types of companies, all of which have varying types of liabilities and thereby are held to different standards under different laws.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Future changes:&lt;/strong&gt; since the UAE is such a young country, its only appropriate that it will be going through changes as it makes it way out of its embryonic stages. One of the major changes upcoming is the possibility of 100% ownership for expatriates. This is as a result of some mounting international pressure (WTO etc) that are calling for UAE to allow for more foreign investments (especially outside the free zones, which already have high rates of foreign investment)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, 50% ownership with an Emirati citizen is required. In the same breath, there is no path to citizenship in the country. So only UAE nationals qualify as citizens, and they only account for about 10% of the population here in Dubai. So you can do the math for yourself, 10% of the population required to fulfill that 50% ownership statute can create somewhat of a hurdle for new businesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since business culture and practices are so closely tied to the very fabric of this country, it was interesting to learn about the legal aspects of commercial entities. I’m sure as I spend more time talking to more people, I will continue to learn more about business and the strong hold it has in the Emirates.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Preliminary Thoughts on Google Buzz and The Diffusion of Innovations Model</title>

   <updated>2010-02-10T13:35:51-05:00</updated>
   <id>/talks/technology/2010/02/10/preliminary-thoughts-on-google-buzz-and-the-diffusion-of-innovations-model</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;After a while of just posting about Dubai, I thought I’d comment on something of interest other than my recent travels in the Middle East. With the new launch of &lt;a href=&quot;google.com/buzz&quot;&gt;Google Buzz&lt;/a&gt;, I thought this would be a good time to blog about social media. In specific I’d like to outline a new model I learned about and using the example of Google Buzz I’d like to comment on the diffusion of new media technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The diffusion of innovations model tries to outline and understand how new innovations permeate society and become efficacious tools for people to use. Although its origins stem from health promotion I think it can readily be applied to new technology and society, including new media technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The three main components of this model are as follows (in parenthesis will be how I believe these models apply, at first glance, to something like Google Buzz)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Characteristics of the innovation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a. Relative advantage (I think the fact that Buzz uses a highly utilized platform such as Gmail as its base provides an advantage)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;b. Compatibility (Google users are usually interested in aggregating their internet use, heck there’s even a complete OS being developed for Google users)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;c. Complexity (this seems to be a bit of a contentious point so far, although I think with feedback and some time, people will be able to use Buzz seamlessly)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;d. Triability (I think some early Twitter users fall off the board when they fail to realize its utility as a micro-blogging tool, rather than a life-caster, which could be something Buzz users might fall prey to)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. The Diffusion Process&lt;/strong&gt; (this is referring to the actual launch and dissemination of Buzz)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. The adopters&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a. Innovators (Google developers, people with high ranking Google accounts and relationships)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;b. Early adopters (Google users with wide-spread and meaningful social relationships online, who use Buzz effectively)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;c. Early majority adopters (moving more towards lighter users but still those with some social capitol to capitalize)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;d. Late majority adopters (still moving down the line of user status, but still among those who are somewhat engaged)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;e. Laggards (people who will not use Buzz at all, or expend any social capitol to let Buzz take off)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, I think Buzz is a worthwhile operation for Google. I know I myself, and my close friends have tried to find a way to share content in the most meaningful yet most comfortable way. So far it has been restrictive, whether through StumbleUpon, Facebook, Twitter, Google Reader or Google-Wave or Gmail conversations. Perhaps Google Buzz will strike that golden balance and have a seamless transition into my internet usage habits. For now, I look forward to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.com/profiles/samarth.bhaskar&quot;&gt;entrusting more of my life&lt;/a&gt; in Google’s hands.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>On Living in the Hyphen, and New Perspectives</title>
   <link href="/dubai/middle%20east/talks/2010/02/04/on-living-in-the-hyphen-and-new-perspectives/"/>

   <id>/dubai/middle%20east/talks/2010/02/04/on-living-in-the-hyphen-and-new-perspectives</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;blockquote&gt;“Receive with simplicity everything that happens to you” – Rashi&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being here in Dubai for about a month now has been a wonderful experience. As mentioned in earlier posts, I have met some of the most interesting and kind people, seen a truly global city and felt more at home than ever as a visitor. One of the best things that has happened to me here is my heightened sense of awareness of my own identity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I have spoken about before, this city is primarily comprised of expatriates, the majority of whom are of varied and multi-cultural backgrounds. Although I am an immigrant myself, and have split my life, thus far, between two lands, I feel largely American. I grew up in America, I became who I am in America, I aspire to be American and I surround myself with Americans. Being Indian-American or South-Asian American in the United States (something I hadn’t really embraced until college) provided some interesting questions and choices, but that’s not really what I’m here to talk about now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being here in Dubai has made me realize that having a colorful past and representing a hyphenated identity is actually pretty remarkable and valuable in itself. Being surrounded by people who speak multiple languages, have family around the world, or need a couple of minutes to answer the question “where are you from” makes me realize that living in the hyphen is not necessarily a place without a home, but a home itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I truly do believe that I live in the hyphen (although perhaps closer to the American side than the Indian side) and I’m pretty happy about it. It is an opportunity afforded to me and is a unique experience that I can call my own. Out of it I have acquired a storied Indian culture, language and set of memories as well as an American culture, language and set of experiences. I’m not interested in trying to portray some sort of balance between the two or a particular preference for either, but instead to say that I’m proud to have an hyphenated identity and living here in Dubai has made me even more proud of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While visiting a family friend tonight, I got to speak at length about Indians here in Dubai, local Emiratis and their (my family friend’s) experience living in Dubai for 30 plus years. It was fascinating to learn about the ways in which Dubai has rapidly changed, even in the last 10 years, the changes in leadership between Sheikh Rashid and Sheikh Muhammad, the ways in which South-Asians have prospered in Dubai, direct foreign financial investment and a multitude of other topics. It was great to get perspectives from a practicing business-man and his family who have been residents in Dubai for more than three decades. Some of the interesting points they mentioned were  the fact that although Dubai is considered “tax free” there are still many ways in which the Emirati minority maintains a certain level of control. Primarily through the policies of the monarchy, Emiratis have been able to enjoy the progresses made primarily by expatriates. For example, no expatriate is allowed to apply for citizenship or own a business without Emirati sponsorship. So, even if you are running a multi-million dollar business as a foreign national in Dubai, you are required to have a partner or sponsor of Emirati origin. Meaning that sponsor or partner merely signs his name (most of the time) and enjoys a share of your profits. Similarly, for a long time, foreign nationals were not allowed to own property in Dubai, so the large population of expatriates had to rent from locals, who received the benefits of booming real estate as thousands of expatriates poured into Dubai.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thoroughly enjoyed spending time with the family tonight and got a great deal of new perspectives on Dubai. I’m looking forward to taking these inquiries further in depth and seeing how I can understand Dubai better.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>On Multiculturalism and Hospitality in Dubai</title>
   <link href="/dubai/middle%20east/2010/01/26/on-multiculturalism-and-hospitality-in-dubai/"/>
   <updated>2010-01-26T12:28:29-05:00</updated>
   <id>/dubai/middle%20east/2010/01/26/on-multiculturalism-and-hospitality-in-dubai</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;If I had to pick one thing that I have enjoyed most about my time in Dubai (aside from the amazing food I’ve been eating, because let’s be honest, nothing would ever be able to top that) it would be how incredibly friendly and hospitable the people here are. I have noticed a considerable difference in social interactions here in Dubai as compared to back in the States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In reading and learning about the Middle East, I had heard that it was customary if you were someone walking into a room or a conversation already on-going it was  to introduce yourself and shake everyone’s hands (although this norm differs among genders). However, seeing this custom in practice has been pretty fantastic. It completely revamps and takes the majority of the pressure of f of social situations. In the US, I would say as a general assertion, social interactions as a young-adult are pretty confusing to master. Meeting someone for the first time, walking into an on-going conversation, entering a gathering as an individual, being an outsider can be reason for panic for some or (at best) require skillful social tactics for others. Here in Dubai, everyone (students, retail service workers, faculty, administrators, cab-drivers, metro/bus operators) has been tremendously friendly and welcoming from the get-go. I have made many friends around campus and found it very easy to join in on social groups/activities without much trepidation of being an awkward outsider, which is even more remarkable given that I’m a study abroad student.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This brings up another interesting detail about Dubai, and about me specifically. Being South-Asian in Dubai is like being white in the United States.  There is a huge population of South-Asians (something I plan on writing about more in depth at a later date), and consequently people assume most of the time that I am someone of Indian or Pakistani origin raised in Dubai and attending AUD. It takes some convincing and detailing of my life-story to convey to people that I am an American studying abroad here, like other American students. In all honesty, this situation is more of a blessing than anything else. I can usually get by with walking around the city without being noticed (which is something that most of the Americans, girls especially, who are studying abroad cannot afford to do). Although this city is by-and-large a safe place, being in unknown surroundings can make anyone feel uncomfortable or unsafe, but because I blend in I think I have a certain sense of comfort that many other study-abroad students would not have. In addition to this, I can also avoid (for the most part) being boxed into the normative American (or American student) identity. Which brings me to my last and most interesting point about Dubai.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There really is no concept of normative homogenous identity here in Dubai. In the US, at least outside of metropolitan cities like Chicago, New York , LA and so on, I have found that there’s no real guess-work when it comes to figuring out who people are (in a general sense) and where’ they’re from. Here in Dubai, I have yet to meet a person whom I can confidently say is ­_____ nationality or _____ ethnicity or of _____ background. I know all of these things are social constructs anyway, but my point is that the way Dubai has developed over the last few decades  it has attracted the most multi-national and multi-cultural of residents, creating new social constructs of its own, unique unto itself. Everyone I meet has an interesting life-story. Born in Nigeria, went to school in London, studying now in Dubai before going to the US. Or parents are Palestinian/Lebanese, can’t get a Palestinian passport so lived in Dubai for most of his childhood, went to Germany to find employment, kicked out because of Palestinian papers, back in Dubai for the time being. These are just the watered down versions and still I could go on. It has been wonderful to be able to meet someone new, learn about their varied and colorful past, and realize that in all likelihood, the future will be comprised of more people like this as opposed to the alternative. Some would argue that living a life like this doesn’t give you a sense of a home or a land, but I would say that living a life like this doesn’t bind you to a land that in turn causes you to alienate others or see them as opposites. Living a life like this makes you more cognizant of the (in my opinion) fact that we all ultimately share the same homeland.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>After a Couple of Weeks</title>
   <link href="/dubai/middle%20east/2010/01/22/after-a-couple-of-weeks/"/>
   <updated>2010-01-22T07:35:54-05:00</updated>
   <id>/dubai/middle%20east/2010/01/22/after-a-couple-of-weeks</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Below are just a few sporadic and random thoughts I’ve been thinking about Dubai and the Gulf in my first couple of weeks here. They are in no specific order, nor are they fully fleshed out, just things I wanted to say and more importantly hear from others about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. The rule of law in Dubai –&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dubai seems to have a very interesting relationship between the government and the governed. On one hand, the city is very safe. This, according to most of my friends here, is because even petty crime is severely punishable (a fact widely known by residents) which means even the thought of committing a crime has to be weighed against the possibility of being punished severely if caught. On the other hand, prostitution is rather popular and not much of a secret. On more than one occasion I have heard stories about students at AUD going out to night-clubs and seeing prostitutes crowd the streets outside, be propositioned by men (natives and expatriates, alike) and so on. Some of the working-class neighborhoods are even known to have prostitutes walking the streets in broad daylight without much concern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the same vein, a couple of stories have made &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/22/world/middleeast/22uae.html?partner=rss&amp;amp;emc=rss&quot;&gt;international news&lt;/a&gt; recently about Dubai and the UAE. One concerns a British tourist who claimed she had been raped at a night-club by a waiter, here in Dubai. Upon voicing her complaint to the Police Department in Jebel Ali, she and her fiancé  were arrested and charged with illegal consumption of alcohol and illegal pre-marital sex (with her fiancé who was with her at the police station and the night-club). Another famous incident involved the brother of the UAE’s president. Sheik Issa bin Zayed al-Nahayan was charged with brutally beating (including running over with an SUV) an Afghan merchant. The courts, citing the influence of prescribed medicine, acquitted Sheikh Issa of any crimes. Both of these stories have received minimal attention here in Emirati media. Although I have only been here 2 weeks, I would venture to say that if I asked any other students here on campus, or people on the streets, they would know very little about these two otherwise important stories.  I suppose at the end of the day the UAE is a monarchy, despite how modern it may seem with tall buildings, expensive cars and extravagant malls. And as in any other monarchy, your proximity to the monarch does mean the law applies to you differently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of the overall feel of law or lawlessness in Dubai, I think for the most part Emiratis and other natives have given Dubai up to expatriates and immigrants. One would be hard-pressed to find an area in Dubai that he/she could call the “Arab neighborhood,” while it is easy to point out Filipino neighborhoods, Indo-Pakistani neighborhoods, areas home to Europeans and North-Americans, etc. In becoming multi-national, I think Dubai has lost some of its own nationalism. While saying this, I am also keenly aware of the multi-billion dollar bailout that Dubai was afforded by neighboring emirate Abu Dhabi, so I suppose there is some level of camaraderie still left between the emirates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. The academic experience here at AUD –&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, I have found the academic environment here at AUD to be akin to that of high school. Students here seem to be far more interested in their cars, clothes and social circles than in the classes they are paying thousands of Dirham to take. As in high school, if you wanted to be engaged with your academic experience in a meaningful way, you would have to step up and take charge of it, otherwise it was rather easy to be another face in the crowd and slide through. Perhaps it was just my experience at U of I, but in the last 3 years there I found it to be more the norm to be academically engaged than to be disconnected. Since I am interested in making the most of my academic experience, I have already found that it will take a lot of initiative on my part to get more out of my classes than just the power-points, lectures, readings, essays and exams. Not to say that I am discouraged by this, but I am just recognizing the fact that a lot of students would not bother to take similar initiatives. At the same time, maybe I’m just too academically oriented and can’t seem to see past the student experience. Oh well, I like it, it works for me. And in all honesty, this is the time in life when I can be a student and be immersed in it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. Dubai Marathon –&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This morning I got to watch and cheer on the runners of the Standard Chartered Dubai Marathon. World record holder Haile Gebreselassie won his 3&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt; straight title in a time of 2:06.09. It was incredible to see an elite athlete like Gebreselassie complete such a feat of human accomplishment. Having completed my first marathon in October 2009, I can truly say it was an amazing moment to be cheering him on and watching him complete the 40 km in less than half the time it took me. I’m still awe-struck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll have more comments later, I’m sure, about these and other topics. In the meanwhile, comment so I can hear from you all.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>A few thoughts on Haiti</title>
   <link href="/international%20relations/politics/talks/2010/01/15/a-few-thoughts-on-haiti/"/>
   <updated>2010-01-15T08:12:47-05:00</updated>
   <id>/international%20relations/politics/talks/2010/01/15/a-few-thoughts-on-haiti</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;Are you willing to be a by-stander who says nothing as Nero starts The Great Fire of Rome?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- P. Sainath, 2006&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been reading coverage on the issue of the recent &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Americas/2010/0114/Haitian-earthquake-relief-Neighbors-help-neighbors-as-aid-trickles-in&quot;&gt;devastating earthquake in Haiti&lt;/a&gt; over the last couple of days, just like many of you have. I have read the numerous calls for actions, donation, sympathy, consideration and concern that many of my friends, colleagues and compatriots have promoted. I have found myself also wondering why there is little or no discussion of it here in Dubai, but then also realizing that Dubai, and the Gulf, has its own worries to concern itself with and is not as close in proximity to Haiti as the United States (nor nearly as tied historically). Throughout all of this, I still keep finding myself being concerned, not merely for those who have lost their lives and been greatly affected already by this travesty, but for those who have yet to be affected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an effort to clearly state my condolences to those who have lost their lives, their families and the suffering nation of Haiti, I want to state that I am only writing about this because I thought it was important and an appropriate time to consider such a topic. I certainly do not want to seem opportunistic or as if I’m trying to divert attention away from the needs of the nation currently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that being said, I would like to take up the important issue of disaster relief aid being poured into Haiti.  In 2006, as a freshman at the University of Illinois, I was fortunate enough to attend a lecture where famed Indian journalist &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P._Sainath&quot;&gt;Palagummi Sainath&lt;/a&gt; spoke about famine, drought and suicide among Indian farmers, as a result of the global food market and insufferable pressures. As an opening to his talk, Mr. Sainath spoke about the fact that stock and investment prices soared after the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2004_Indian_Ocean_earthquake&quot;&gt;tsunami that struck South-Asia in 2004.&lt;/a&gt; He posed an interesting question at the time, asking why it would be that stocks, investments and corporations would directly benefit from a natural disaster that killed and displaced so many. The answer he provided was humbling, at best. Mr. Sainath claimed that upon speaking to a friend of his in the investment industry, he realized that the benefits these investors were looking forward to and beginning to invest in preemptively were those they expected to trickle down from foreign relief aid. These investors realized that the world community would mobilize to come to the aid of those affected by the tsunami and provide millions of dollars in relief aid but ultimately, because of the way the system in India, Sri Lanka and elsewhere had been set up, the money would not go to help those in need, but instead would be used for the benefit of infrastructure and development in the corporate interests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this is the point that concerns me most about all the calls for foreign aid and relief that are being touted the world over for Haiti.  It makes me proud to hear about the money raised by the &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.forbes.com/digitaldownload/2010/01/haiti-aid-comes-by-tweet-and-text/&quot;&gt;Red Cross’s text campaign&lt;/a&gt;, or by private corporations and individuals or the efforts of the American armed forces and government. But I am ultimately concerned about how this aid will be used by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE60D5VB20100114?feedType=RSS&amp;amp;feedName=topNews&amp;amp;utm_source=feedburner&amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+reuters%2FtopNews+%28News+%2F+US+%2F+Top+News%29&quot;&gt;those in charge in Haiti&lt;/a&gt;. For now I think I’ll wait with guarded optimism to see if the efforts of the global community can really espouse local change. As Mr. Sainath has said himself in reference to Western Organizations, Capitalism and Socialism, “political opportunism and media management have provided the appearance of different choices and systems, without any meaningful changes in outcomes.”&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>First Impressions of Dubai</title>

   <id>/dubai/2010/01/11/first-impressions-of-dubai</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:left;&quot;&gt;- &quot;&lt;em&gt;Ambition. Its the reason 208 different nationalities can live together&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:left;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style:normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;- &quot;You&#39;re a capitalist. Capitalize&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:left;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;- &quot;Ambition. It&#39;s the one thing economists don&#39;t have a chart for.&quot; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:left;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;- &quot;Markets fluctuate. Ambition doesn&#39;t.&quot; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:left;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;- &quot;It&#39;s not how much you make. It&#39;s what you make with it.&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:left;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;- quotes found in student publications around the AUD campus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:left;&quot;&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:left;&quot;&gt;I was flipping through one of the student publications I found on campus and I saw these quotes noted near the bottoms of some pages as style notes and they really captured how my first few days in Dubai have left an impression of limitless ambition on me. As far as exploring the city, I&#39;ve done primarily touristy type things for the first few days. I figured I would give myself some time to be a mindless tourist before I got sick of that kind of stuff and started looking for something else more engaging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:left;&quot;&gt;Malls in Dubai are an experience unto themselves. I haven&#39;t stepped into a single mall with the intent of shopping for anything but have still managed to spend large parts of some days there. So far I&#39;ve visited &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.malloftheemirates.com/en/Default.aspx&quot;&gt;Emirates Mall&lt;/a&gt; (home of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.malloftheemirates.com/en/Entertainment/SkiDubai/&quot;&gt;Ski Dubai&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ibnbattutamall.com/&quot;&gt;Ibn Buttuta Mall&lt;/a&gt; (modeled after the travels of 14th century &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibn_Battuta&quot;&gt;Islamic scholar&lt;/a&gt; who is the namesake) and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thedubaimall.com/en&quot;&gt;Dubai Mall&lt;/a&gt;. These malls are all far bigger, more luxurious, way more expensive and certainly intended to be all inclusive experiences than malls in the United States. Dubai Mall, for example, had a beautiful water fountain, a ice-skating rink, a water fall, an aquarium, high fashion stores, a gold marketplace, a 26 screen multiplex and more retail stores than I could begin to look at. Its location right next to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burj_Khalifa&quot;&gt;Burj Khalifa&lt;/a&gt; meant that I got to sit outside on a patio with a waterfall while eating lunch and staring at the Burj Khalifa. The incident of lunch (comprised of delicious Lebanese food at that) really captured my first experiences in Dubai.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:left;&quot;&gt;All in all, I&#39;m having a reaction similar to any tourist would. I&#39;m amazed at all the buildings, impressed with the lifestyle, dumbfounded at the luxury, floored by the opulence and constantly experiencing sensory over-load. If you&#39;re interested in seeing this in action, I&#39;d recommend watching any of my recent &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/samarthbhaskar&quot;&gt;You-Tube&lt;/a&gt; videos as they capture this sense of wide-eyed enchantment pretty well. While talking to one of my floor-mates last night, I realized that this is pretty much a typical reaction to Dubai for most people. He said he would ask me the same question now, as I&#39;ve recently arrived, and again when I&#39;m ready to leave in four months time. He then proceeded to ask me what I thought of Dubai. I answered with some of the same, talking about how elaborate I thought it was, the malls being so big and fancy, the buildings being so picaresque and so on. Rashid said that I answered as expected and as he expects, I will be very disillusioned by the time I leave in April.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:left;&quot;&gt;In truth, I knew all of this to begin with. I understood relatively well how lavish this city is, although seeing it in person certainly has its own merits. Dubai&#39;s reputation precedes it in many ways. Knowing all of this full and well, I still think there&#39;s something exciting about letting go of my nuanced understandings, my informed opinion or whatever the case may be and just taking it in at first with new eyes. I could have very easily been callous to it all and taken the attitude of &quot;well yeah, so what?&quot; but I think that would have been a disservice to my time here. I have been blessed with this opportunity and I intend on taking everything from it that I can. For the first few days, and maybe a few more since it&#39;s so dang fun, I&#39;d like to just be touristy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:left;&quot;&gt;As far as the quotes above are concerned, I think they speak loudly to something I&#39;ve been feeling about Dubai already, which is that all this expansion and luxury is relatively baseless. I haven&#39;t had enough time to formally develop these ideas or test them in any way, but my visceral understanding is that there&#39;s really not much underneath the surface of shiny tall buildings, big huge malls and &lt;a href=&quot;http://dubaimetro.eu/#section3976&quot;&gt;spaceship metro stations&lt;/a&gt;. Sometimes I think the buildings have been built just for buildings sake, not really to house anything as big.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:left;&quot;&gt;Some of the other highlights include the fact that I&#39;ve spoken more Hindi in my time here than English or Arabic. There are as many South-Asians here in Dubai as anyone will lead you to believe (actually, probably more). In terms of the financial crisis, I really can&#39;t say if Dubai has been hit hard or not since I was not here before, but from what I&#39;ve asked my friends here, the city is less crowded than it used to be as people have left after the collapse. The main remnant of the crisis I can see is halted construction of buildings everywhere. I am loving the food; primarily subsisting on a diet of kebabs, hummus, dried nuts and other meats. I&#39;ve also already eaten some of the best Indian food I&#39;ve ever had (including growing up in New Delhi). The infrastructure (highways, roadways, metro etc) is pretty impressive. I think this is a good case-study in what you can really accomplish with virtually limitless resources. There are some interesting media and public information access details that I have noticed (in newspapers and internet access) which I am interested in exploring further as time goes on. People here are really rich (I was behind a woman yesterday who purchased $6000 USD worth of makeup at Yves Saint Laurent).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:left;&quot;&gt;In any case, I plan on enjoying my time here and developing a better understanding of the country and the gulf region. I have some plans cooking for some travel in addition to my academic experience on campus which hopefully will be fulfilling as it has been the last few years back at UIUC.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>First day in Dubai</title>
   <link href="/dubai/2010/01/07/first-day-in-dubai/"/>
   <updated>2010-01-07T12:57:28-05:00</updated>
   <id>/dubai/2010/01/07/first-day-in-dubai</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Just a quick post after my first full day in Dubai -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last night I stayed the night at my friend Eeshaan&#39;s house. He was a huge help yesterday and today so a big thanks to Eeshaan and the Roy family! I tried my best to fall asleep but after sleeping 10 out of the 12 hours on the flight, I wasn&#39;t exactly ready to sleep again right away. So the goal of eliminating any and all jet-lag wasn&#39;t accomplished but I&#39;m hoping today&#39;s full day of running around and not sleeping a wink will help put me on track starting tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I moved in to my dorm room today. It is much bigger than even the triple I lived in my freshman year at UIUC (although not nearly as awesome due to a lack of great roommates like Ty and G). I have a bed, desk, big closet and a bathroom. My roommate seems like a great guy. He&#39;s from Tehran and we&#39;ve already talked a few times about Iran/US relations (more on that later...). He&#39;s into cinema and movies so we definitely have that in common.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got a phone today and will shortly be activating a Skype number so I&#39;ll be pretty readily available to those in the U.S. and elsewhere. My number here is +971503982969.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been driving around Dubai quite a bit and am absolutely amazed at the grandeur of the city. It is elaborate in every sense. I can&#39;t quite do justice to all my first impressions just yet (mostly because its late and I&#39;m tired) but I definitely plan on posting some of reactions to seeing the huge buildings, extensive infrastructure, sprawling shopping centers and malls, et al. Suffice it to say for now, every time I drive by the Burj Khalifa I can&#39;t believe my eyes and still think it looks computer generated even in reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time to get some rest for now and hopefully spend more time exploring the city tomorrow. I&#39;ll try and write a succinct and annotated update about my first few days later on this weekend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to all who have been posting, commenting and asking about my time here. Its always great to be reminded of how many people care about me.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>On Travel</title>
   <link href="/general/talks/2010/01/05/on-travel/"/>
   <updated>2010-01-05T19:43:52-05:00</updated>
   <id>/general/talks/2010/01/05/on-travel</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;em&gt;“All the lives we could live, all the people we will never know, never will be, they are everywhere. That is what the world is.”  -- Aleksandar Hemon, The Lazarus Project&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A while ago I read an essay by one of my favorite pseudo mainstream neuroscience researchers, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jonahlehrer.com/&quot;&gt;Jonah Lehrer&lt;/a&gt; called “&lt;a href=&quot;http://scienceblogs.com/cortex/2009/12/why_we_travel.php&quot;&gt;Why We Travel&lt;/a&gt;.” It put into a neurological perspective something I have felt for a long time. I have always had a particular penchant for travelling. As soon as I got my license as a 16 year old, I was always suggesting and trying to set up road trips. I spent a great deal of time in college travelling around the country with my &lt;a href=&quot;http://chaitown.org/&quot;&gt;a cappella&lt;/a&gt; group. Although travelling clearly has a very basic level of enjoyment attached to it, I have always felt like there’s something more that makes it so attractive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lehrer, in “Why We Travel&lt;em&gt;,”&lt;/em&gt; makes a convincing argument that travel is a natural human desire. He says that we travel because we need to, because it fulfills a natural desire in our minds. His closing line is powerful, for me – “When we get home, home is still the same. But something in our mind has been changed, and that changes everything.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first time I travelled under my own auspices was when I came back from India after attending a cousin’s wedding in the winter of 2004. I spent a 5 hour layover in Paris Charles De Gaulle (one of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cnn.com/2009/TRAVEL/01/12/worst.airports/index.html&quot;&gt;worst airports&lt;/a&gt; in the world, by the way), and started to appreciate time spent people-watching, strolling around, thinking and feeling unnoticed. One of my favorite parts about spending time in airports is the thought that no one is interested in who I am, what I’m doing or where I’m going. Although I’m not one to shy away from the responsibility that is associated with being a member of a community (communities like my home, school, friends, etc.) it is nice to take a break from it and enjoy a certain level of anonymity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have already spent more than 12 hours in transit since I left home this morning, and I still haven’t left the country. I’m sure many people would find this a cumbersome and frustrating experience but I revel in it. I always look forward to travelling, especially by myself, so much so that I dress up for it, ha. I enjoy grabbing a few books, having my laptop and phone with  me, walking around terminals, planning how I’m going to maneuver the security line (especially the moment where it goes from dormant-standing-in-line to a mad dash where you feel like you’re doing everything wrong under the watchful eye of big-TSA-brother).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the quote above captures very well and as Lehrer explains, I think travelling/migration/emigration all capture a certain level of humanity (heck, its even part of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hrweb.org/legal/undocs.html&quot;&gt;UN Agreements on Human Right&lt;/a&gt;s). Nothing is as humbling and grounding as the understanding that you are one small part of a larger reality.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Study Abroad in Dubai, UAE</title>
   <link href="/dubai/2010/01/02/study-abroad-in-dubai-uae/"/>
   <updated>2010-01-02T15:45:27-05:00</updated>
   <id>/dubai/2010/01/02/study-abroad-in-dubai-uae</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;The destination is much less a place than a new way of seeing things.&quot; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;--- Henry Miller&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/January_5&quot;&gt;January 5th&lt;/a&gt; 2010 I will be flying to &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dubai&quot;&gt;Dubai&lt;/a&gt; in the United Arab Emirates for a semester study abroad at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://aud.edu/&quot;&gt;American University in Dubai&lt;/a&gt;. This will fulfill my last requirement for graduation as an International Studies major from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. At AUD I will primarily be studying Middle Eastern Studies, including comparative politics, history and media as well as Arabic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was originally supposed to study abroad in Fall of 2009 but due to some last minute administrative mix-ups, I had to postpone my trip to Spring 2010. So finally, after what seems like quite a build up of anticipation, I will be heading off to the Middle East. This will constitute my most extensive stay abroad, save my current residence in the United States from 1998 onwards. I spent about three and a half weeks in Istanbul, Turkey my freshman year through a study abroad program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an effort to centralize all of my experiences and engage with my time in Dubai in a meaningful way, I will be using this blog to publish how I spend my time in the UAE. Readers can expect to see photos, videos, essays, ruminations, etc. here. As mentioned elsewhere on this blog, readers can also follow my &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/samarthbhaskar&quot;&gt;tweets &lt;/a&gt;from Dubai, subscribe to my &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/samarthbhaskar/&quot;&gt;Flickr &lt;/a&gt;feed, follow me on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.com/profiles/samarth.bhaskar&quot;&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; Reader or find out more about me on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.facebook.com/samarthbhaskar&quot;&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As means of a quick summary of my pursuits in the area thus far - I am an International Studies major at the University of Illinois. In my major, I have focused on studying the Middle East/Arab world with particular interest in political science, comparative politics, international relations, political communication, new media studies, sociology, gender studies and history as it pertains to this region of the world. In addition to my interest in the social sciences, I have taken six semesters of Arabic yet have barely begun to scratch the surface of this rather challenging language. Although being a native Hindi speaker did help in some ways, Arabic is altogether a complicated language unto itself and I&#39;m looking forward to furthering my study of Arabic at AUD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A little about Dubai - Dubai is one of seven emirates of the United Arab Emirates and holds one of two vetoes (along with Abu Dhabi) in the federal congregation. The majority of the Dubai&#39;s success was once built upon the oil industry, but now primarily consists of tourism, property and financial services. Dubai is considered by many as a truly global city because of its multi-cultural landscape, large expatriate populations and status in the world as a luxurious tourist destination. As such, Dubai will give me yet another experience of a city and culture on the brink (the others being New Delhi, my birthplace and Istanbul). As I found in my time in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Istanbul-Memories-City-Orhan-Pamuk/dp/1400040957&quot;&gt;Istanbul&lt;/a&gt;, the city of Istanbul and the country of Turkey were both in the process of forging their own identity as entities caught between two worlds. I&#39;m interested to see if Dubai, similarly, has developed an identity as a city placed in the Middle East yet exhibiting all the characteristics of Western life. Ultimately, I find this identity is an interesting case study in the way in which cultures, or as Huntington would say &quot;civilizations,&quot; interact. These contact points often serve as interesting anecdotes for how the larger global context may take shape in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an effort to stop the guess work, I&#39;ll leave the rest of my observations about Dubai for when I get there. In the meantime, I would encourage readers to comment and dialog on this blog as I spend the next 4 months in the Middle East. If I know you personally, I would love to hear from you. If we&#39;re not friends yet, I hope you&#39;ll comment so I can expand the scope of this blog beyond a personal-public journal.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Why I love Jazz.</title>
   <link href="/music/2009/04/15/why-i-love-jazz/"/>
   <updated>2009-04-15T18:34:55-04:00</updated>
   <id>/music/2009/04/15/why-i-love-jazz</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve been asked many times, by many of my friends, why I love jazz. I have always had a hard time putting into words how jazz makes me feel, or what I think about when I listen to jazz, or where my interest started (although most credit belongs to a select few high school friends). But even if I tried to explain all of these things, I don&#39;t think I&#39;d come close to explain how much I love jazz, and how I wish I knew so much more about it (besides just knowing about different artists, being able to glean different themes and appreicate improvisations).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just read Wynton Marsalis&#39;s &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Moving-Higher-Ground-Jazz-Change/dp/1400060788/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;qid=1239842803&amp;amp;sr=8-2&quot;&gt;Moving to Higher Ground&lt;/a&gt;: How jazz can change your life. &lt;/em&gt;His take on jazz and what jazz has meant to him really rung true in many ways for me. If nothing else, it gave me some good ways to describe why I love jazz so much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Available and understandable: Marsalis says that Jazz is summed up, sanctified and accesible to anyone who learns to listen to, feel and understand it. Although I started out not really understanding jazz, spending time with it and having a curiosity about it really helped me learn to appreciate it. Having a penchant for rythmic complexity also helped because I could listen to one song or one artist so many times without ever running out of new things to learn from it. This made the learning experience like breaking apart a piece of literature instead of just an aesthetic pleasure (although it had that quality to it too).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Opening up the core of a musician: listening to and profiling an artist has become a great hobby of mine. If you spend time listening to one artist (Coltrane, Miles Davis, Clifford Brown, Freddie Hubbard, Joshua Redman, Gregory Hutchinson) you can start learning so much about them. Spending time listening to one artist and learning about, what Marsalis calls &quot;the center of [a musician&#39;s] being,&quot; can make the experience so much more about the musician than what they sign their name on. This kind of signature sound and style is hard to come by in other genres (save some vocalists).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Improvisation: this is arguably my favorite part of jazz music, especially live jazz music. I am absolutely floored by the kind of skills and talents professional and even amateur jazz musicians command. The natural talents, coupled with the hours of training that these musicians put into their work, can create some of the most amazing works. Listening to just 3 musicians (a bassist, a drummer and a saxophonist for example) work together and play off of each other&#39;s strengths to create some of the most intricate and complex improvisations is a feat of human acheivement, as far as I am concerned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been surrounded by music since childhood, but in my young adulthood I have really been able to engage with it in a meaningful way. The role that music plays in my life has evolved just as much as my tastes in music have (those two are probably factors of each other, actually). I hope I can provide my children with the same kinds of appreciations for music and creation that I have been blessed with.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>15th Anniversary of Rwandan Genocide</title>
   <link href="/international%20relations/politics/2009/04/07/15th-anniversary-of-rwandan-genocide/"/>
   <updated>2009-04-07T15:10:11-04:00</updated>
   <id>/international%20relations/politics/2009/04/07/15th-anniversary-of-rwandan-genocide</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Today, April 7th, is the 15th anniversary of the Rwandan genocide. In 1994, 800,000 people were killed over a period of 100 days. That equals 8,000 people a day, for 100 days. That&#39;s more than 2 and a half times the number of people killed on 9/11, for 100 consecutive days, in a country with a population equivalent to New York City. 1 in 10 Rwandans were murdered and millions more displaced. All of this happened while the rest of the world stood and watched without interfering, because it didn&#39;t want to get its hands dirty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taking the example of then President Clinton, who refused to get involved because of the blunder that happened in Somalia a few years before, I think its clear that these mistakes were not a one time thing (Read: Darfur, Burma, etc). Referring to the genocide in Rwanda as &quot;genocide like events&quot; or &quot;instances of genocide&quot; instead calling it genocide in order to absolve himself of the responsibilities associated with genocide as a leader in the international community. Although he has come out and apologized since, its really to no avail for those affected by this conflict.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In memory of those who lost their lives, I think its incumbent upon us to hold our own governments and the international community responsible for these instances and to make sure things like this become absolutely impermissible in the future. Of course I&#39;m talking about genocide being  impermissible but also the apathy, indifference and lack of responsibility on the part of the international community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&#39;re interested in reading further about this event, here are a few of my favorite books and documentaries on the topic&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shake Hands with the Devil - Romeo Dallaire&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shake Hands with the Devil (documentary)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We Wish to Inform you that tomorrow we will be killed with our families: Stories from Rwanda - Phillip Gourevitch&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Israel's New Administration</title>
   <link href="/international%20relations/middle%20east/politics/talks/2009/03/29/israel-article/"/>
   <updated>2009-03-29T18:04:30-04:00</updated>
   <id>/international%20relations/middle%20east/politics/talks/2009/03/29/israel-article</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Today marks Binyamin Netanyahu&#39;s first day in office in Israel. As expected, many have been speculating and providing commentary on how they think the new Israeli administration will fair, especially in relation to its most important foreign (and domestic) affair: its on-going conflict with Palestine. John Mearsheimer and Stephen M. Walt have written extensively on the subject (especially about the Israel lobby in America) and also chimed in on the topic recently. In an essay published in Foreign Policy Magazine (one of my favorite publications since my high school days), Mearsheimer wrote about what he thought the new administration would do in its tenure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also recently had the chance to attend a talk with Norman Finkelstein and Ali Abuminah on campus, and they spoke about the same topic, but more in reference to the historical context. Below are some highlights from both the Mearsheimer essay and the Finkelstein/Abuminah talk -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. Finkelstein: Israel has never conducted a war of necessity. All armed conflict has been a choice on Israel&#39;s part.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. Finkelstein/Abuminah: Israel has no reason to support a two-state solution because it benefits too greatly from its hegemonic rule in the area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. Mearsheimer: Netanyahu is expected to continue Israel&#39;s growth in the West Bank and establishment of a Greater Israel. He also is only expected to pay scarce lip-service to a two-state solution and will continue to conceptualize Palestinians as terrorists. (In fact, he has yet to refer to Palestine as a state).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, I found Finkelstein and Abuminah to be less than academic. Their talks were highly one-sided and almost refused to take a critical look at the actions of such organizations as Hizbollah (or Hezbollah). Abuminah, although not an academic, is a trained journalist, and was not speaking in a journalist&#39;s capacity, did not strive for any kind of a dichotomous analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mearsheimer and Walt, although I have disagreed with them in the past in terms of the Israel lobby&#39;s influence on American law-makers, did create an impressive question to leave readers with: What exactly is the benefit for Jews from Israel&#39;s expansionist policies? Although some would respond by asking why Israel needs to justify its political actions, I would ask in return, why the justification comes as such a burden when in fact millions of people&#39;s lives are in question.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Dead Aid - Dambisa Moyo</title>
   <link href="/international%20relations/politics/2009/03/25/dead-aid/"/>
   <updated>2009-03-25T15:16:39-04:00</updated>
   <id>/international%20relations/politics/2009/03/25/dead-aid</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I just finished reading &lt;em&gt;Dead Aid: Why Aid is not Working and How There is a Better Way for Africa&lt;/em&gt; by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dambisamoyo.com/&quot;&gt;Dambisa Moyo&lt;/a&gt;. I also &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theworld.org/?q=taxonomy_by_date/1/20090325&quot;&gt;caught&lt;/a&gt; her on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theworld.org/&quot;&gt;The World&lt;/a&gt; by Public Radio International on the way home this afternoon. After reading a little more about her, I can say I&#39;m truly impressed. Just to name a few of her accomplishments, Moyo has worked for Goldman Sachs, the World Bank and is on the board of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jbs.cam.ac.uk/research/centres/cibam/&quot;&gt;Cambridge University&#39;s Centre for International Business and Management (CIBAM)&lt;/a&gt;. She has taken macroeconomic issues and applied them to her homeland of Zambia and Africa in a very innovative way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below are some highlights from her book and radio interview:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. Aid is not helping Africa: Her take-home argument is that the $1 trillion dollars in aid that African nations have received in the last 50 years (really puts the &lt;a href=&quot;http://abcnews.go.com/Business/Economy/story?id=6022145&amp;amp;page=1&quot;&gt;$3 trillion dollar bailout&lt;/a&gt; in perspective) has actually hurt African nations more than it has helped them. &quot;Moyo illuminates the way in which overreliance on aid has trapped developing nations in a vicious circle of aid dependency, corruption, market distortion, and further poverty, leaving them with nothing but the “need” for more aid.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. Why must Africa develop differently than other nations?: Moyo asks why African nations must depend on foreign aid for development instead of following similar paths such as South, Southeast and East-Asian nations. One of her conclusions about foreign aid to African nations is that it is deeply rooted in a sense of pity for the African people. I wonder if there is some post-colonial analysis at work here, or if this alleged pity is just another sense of colonialism through rhetoric and pop-culture instead of militarism and exploitation of resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, Moyo calls for a hault to aid to increase economic growth in Africa. Although her call for a complete hault to aid (except humanitarian and emergency relief aid) is a bit much, I do agree that there needs to be a major recapitualation of how aid is delivered and used by African nations. This recapitualiation, in my opinion, needs to happen on both the side of the donors and on receivers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What&#39;re your thoughts? In a global economic crisis, are you among those who think stopping aid is beneficial for all, or those who believe a time like this is as crucial as any to continue aid?&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Apple recently released the previews for the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apple.com/iphone/preview-iphone-os/&quot;&gt;3.0 iPhone software&lt;/a&gt; update. A lot of interesting updates were announced, at a pretty crucial time (read: Palm Pre&#39;s recent release). Although the updates won&#39;t be available for users for a few months, developers will be able to start developing new apps before the mass-release. Below are some basic pro&#39;s and con&#39;s for me -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PROS: 1. New batch of apps from app developers&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. copy + paste: Finally, this has been a long time coming. I have tried some of the third-party apps but they have been nothing much to speak of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. MMS: this will be a nice addition, although I don&#39;t find myself sending too many media messages via text. I&#39;ve been happy using the email functionality or posting media on the web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4. SMS forwarding: again, nice addition, but haven&#39;t really found a need for it in the past. Maybe if it&#39;s available I&#39;ll make use of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5. Multiple photos in 1 E-mail message: this is something that I have found the need for in the past. Looking forward to having this feature to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6. Spotlight feature on home page: I have about 5 pages of apps, so this will come in handy, although like most iPhone users there are a handful that I use most often.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CONS: 1. The most glaring con is definitely that there is still no-flash available for the iPhone. Hope this get&#39;s changed soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. I can see a hardware change coming soon, which means I will probably want to buy the new device. Which means I will need money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking forward to upgrading and playing around with the new software.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Iraqi Provoncial Elections - Juan Cole talk</title>

   <updated>2009-03-12T14:34:12-04:00</updated>
   <id>/middle%20east/politics/talks/2009/03/12/iraqi-provoncial-elections-juan-cole-talk</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www-personal.umich.edu/~jrcole/&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;Juan Cole&lt;/a&gt; is a professor of Middle Eastern and South-Asian History at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. He maintains a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.juancole.com&quot;&gt;blog &lt;/a&gt;that I frequent and has been featured on many news shows as an expert on Middle Eastern and religion/politic relations.  He visited campus a couple of weeks ago and I had the opportunity to go to one of his talks, about Iraqi provincial elections and I thought it was a great way to learn about the historic context of the current political realities in Iraq. Below are some of what I thought were the take-home points from his talk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A.    Sunni and Arab Nationalism: Sunni&#39;s have traditionally been in the minority in Iraq but have maintained a hegemonic political majority. Arab nationalism privileges Sunnis and marginalizes Kurds and Shiites. Sunni Arabs benefitted disproportionately under the Baath Party (Hussein&#39;s political party)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;B.     Da&#39;wa Party (Islamic mission): this party was formed to emphasize and focus on Shiite cultural identity. They worked toward establishing an Islamic state, as rivals to the communist and Baath parties in the late 1950s and early 1960s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;C.     Supreme Council for Islamic Revolution in Iraq (Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq): this is a political party with roots in Iran. Wanted a pluralistic, parliamentary government with some sort of consultative council (Shura&#39;). Did not abide by the Ayatollah Khomeini&#39;s ideals of religious clerics themselves ruling politically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;D.    Failed Shi&#39;ite Leadership in the 1990s: led to a chasm, some followed Grand Ayatollah Ali Sistani, others followed Ayatollah Mohammed Sadiq al-Sadr (Sadr was assassinated by Saddam Hussein). Sadr was father of current Shi&#39;ite militia leader Muqtada al-Sadr. Sistani established the United Iraqi Alliance (an amalgamation of Shi&#39;ite political parties interested in gaining political representation in Iraq)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;E.     January 30&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;, 2005 elections: Sunni&#39;s did not vote (they were angry about US attacks in Fallujah) and ended up losing a majority of the provinces to Shi&#39;ite and some Kurdish parties. Fundamentalist/hard-lined Shi&#39;ites took over Southern provinces. Iranian Supreme Council for Islamic Revolutions won Diyallah province and Baghdad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;F.      Nuri Al-Maliki: elected Prime Minister of Iraq. Many ties to Hizbollah and other extremist political factions. Stood up to Mahdi army and has gained popularity for defeating them in Spring 2008, especially in Basra province.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Juan Cole&#39;s talk was very informative and his command of the region&#39;s politics came through during his discussion. It further proved my convictions that religion and politics have become (or have always been) inextricable from one another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of what the provincial elections mean for US/Iraq relations, I found that his main point was that hard-lined Shi&#39;ite parties, especially those tied to Iran was something that the mainstream news media in the US does not often discuss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I look forward to exploring this topic further and keeping up with Juan Cole&#39;s commentary on the region.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Welcome! To you, and to me!</title>
   <link href="/general/2009/03/06/welcome-to-you-and-to-me/"/>

   <id>/general/2009/03/06/welcome-to-you-and-to-me</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Welcome everyone!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today marks the day I expand my online presence onto a blog. I have been wanting to start a blog for quite some time and I finally have a reason to do it, namely, a &lt;a href=&quot;https://moodle.atlas.uiuc.edu/course/view.php?id=217&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;class &lt;/a&gt;project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just to give readers a general sense of my interests and what I&#39;ll be posting about, here&#39;s a short list:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Politics/International Relations: my main academic interests lie in International Relations, Comparative Relations and Area studies. With my interests primarily focused in the Middle East and the Muslim world, politics are obviously inextricable from the larger social context, so readers can expect me to comment on politics, sociology, religion, philosophy, anthropology, history, communication theories and media studies as related to the Middle East, the global context as well as the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Techno-stuff: In addition to my academic interests, I often browse and keep up with the most -recent gadgetry. You can expect some commentary on my favorite i Phone apps, new social media and Web 2.0 services, DSLR cameras and whatever strikes my technophilic fancy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Music: I am an avid singer and consumer of music. My favorite genres include &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.joshuaredman.com/&quot;&gt;jazz&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.davematthewsband.com/&quot;&gt;modern rock&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://ericwhitacre.wordpress.com/&quot;&gt;contemporary choral music&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.radiohead.com/deadairspace/&quot;&gt;alternative rock&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.johnlegend.com/us/home&quot;&gt;R&amp;amp;B&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.atribecalledquest.com/world/&quot;&gt;hip&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Star_(hip_hop_group)&quot;&gt;hop&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.chapter6.com/&quot;&gt;A Capella&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sigurros.com/main/home/&quot;&gt;World music&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://nusrat.info/&quot;&gt;South-Asian music&lt;/a&gt;, and a whole lot else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cool Podcasts I hear: I listen to many podcasts throughout the day so you can expect me to write about a few of these every so often. Some of my favorites include &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.radiolab.com&quot;&gt;Radiolab&lt;/a&gt; (WNYC), &lt;a href=&quot;http://http://www.npr.org/templates/rundowns/rundown.php?prgId=13&quot;&gt;Fresh Air&lt;/a&gt; (WHYY), &lt;a href=&quot;http://thisamericanlife.org/&quot;&gt;This American Life&lt;/a&gt; (WBEZ) and the podcasts from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.howstuffworks.com&quot;&gt;How Stuff Works&lt;/a&gt;.com&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other random stuff: I&#39;ll probably end up writing about random stuff that is going on in my real and online life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Places you can find me on the internet: &lt;a href=&quot;0px;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;!-- Facebook Badge END --&amp;gt;&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=1950959&amp;amp;ref=profile#/profile.php?id=1950959&amp;amp;ref=profile&quot;&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://http://twitter.com/samarthbhaskar&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking forward to writing and more to hearing what you all have to say about what I think!&lt;/p&gt;
