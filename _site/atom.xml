   <title>This Boy’s Life</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Tobias Wolff has long been one of my favorite short story writers. I had never read a book-length work from him so while browsing a book store, this book caught my eye. The reading experience, much like Wolff’s short stories, was deceptively easy, seemingly uncomplex and straight forward in a particularly mid-century male American way. But what brews beneath the simple writing in this book is a story full of pain, anguish, shame and longing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The structure and form of the book, including the uncomplicated language and sentence structure, is perfectly fit to the age and life experience of the main character - a young Tobias “Jack” Wolff. To write with any more wisdom would have betrayed an authorial distance that is only present near the end of the book. The rest of the time, the story is best served through this author/character closeness, so we can truly feel how he felt as a boy. We feel a full set of emotions about Dwight, about Wolff’s mother, brother and friends, and about his childhood preoccupations or social and academic struggles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The concept of lying or adherence to truth is always central to any memoir. After reading in this genre deeply for a few years now, I’m tired of this question. There’s a clear betrayal of trust when authors like James Frey pen a fake memoir. But I’m more in the camp of David Carr, say, who knows he is an untrustable narrator but that doesn’t keep him from trying to tell the best version of his story he can. In fact, lying is a central feature in this book for good reason. Young boys, under the thumb of a tyrannical head of household, learn to lie for a reason. It’s a skill for self preservation. And to remove that from Wolff’s story would be to deny a central and fascinating part of this book.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>About Elly</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://letterboxd.com/samarthbhaskar/film/about-elly/&quot;&gt;LetterboxD review link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I saw &lt;em&gt;About Elly&lt;/em&gt; after seeing Asghar Farhadi’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://letterboxd.com/samarthbhaskar/film/the-salesman-2016/&quot;&gt;The Salesman&lt;/a&gt; earlier this week. His &lt;em&gt;A Separation&lt;/em&gt; is one of my favorite foreign films of all time. I was impressed with &lt;em&gt;The Salesman&lt;/em&gt; but not bowled over. I was expecting about the same reaction for &lt;em&gt;About Elly&lt;/em&gt;. But, boy, was I wrong. This film completely knocked me over. I found myself, multiple times, yelling out loud on my couch at home because the story had me wound so tight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lying and deception is a common theme in art made in authoritarian regimes. Farhadi’s films or books like &lt;em&gt;The Orphan Master’s Son&lt;/em&gt;, Adam Johnson’s brilliant novel about North Korea, capture the sense of the collective process through which social reality is built in places like Iran and North Korea. When the rule of law and the guise of politics lack public trust, downstream effects are also found in community building or personal relationships. The inability of each of these characters to be totally honest with one another is not just some personal moral failing, but a structural reality for citizens of totalitarian states.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though themes like this, and marital relations, and middle class life in modern Iran are present in Farhadi’s films, he doesn’t hit you over the head with them. Instead, his writing and directorial talents are laser focused on story telling. The script for this film is masterful. Every reveal, every plot turn and twist is perfectly calibrated, introduced at the right time, tied up and explained through dialog perfectly. The blocking, framing and lighting choices Farhadi makes as a director are brilliant. The performances he gets out of his actors, especially characters like Peyman, Sepideh and Alireza are fantastic. This is a nearly perfectly told story from start to finish, with ebbs-and-flows like the ocean that keeps pulling you further in just when you thought you had your footing in the sand. A chamber piece for the ages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lucia Berlin’s short story “A Manual for Cleaning Women” kept coming up for me during this film. Probably because of the direct connection in terms of the protagonist’s occupation but also because of the emotional quality of this film. The current focus on refugees in today’s news cycle was also on my mind. Fatima and Nesrine are hard working, aware of their place as immigrants and lower class citizens in France, aware of the racial prejudices against Arabs, aware that they must keep their emotions and egos in check and put all their focus on making a good life in this new place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like Berlin’s writing, this film is sparse and concerned with every day details. The emotions, however, are remarkably clear on the screen. The non-professional acting is sometimes distracting but it is balanced by adept directing and editing. A film made by and seemingly for women, &lt;em&gt;Fatima&lt;/em&gt; is a well executed short story in the life of an immigrant family trying to make it in the modern world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A pivotal scene in the &lt;em&gt;The Salesman&lt;/em&gt; shows the camera holding on a door left open. It reminded me of the windows we see in &lt;a href=&quot;http://letterboxd.com/samarthbhaskar/film/elle/&quot;&gt;Elle&lt;/a&gt;, also left open, also portending violence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The role of Iranian society, as in &lt;em&gt;A Separation&lt;/em&gt;, is hard to avoid. A woman brought to a hospital after a violent incident is asked no questions. Neighbors and co-workers are at once highly involved in the protagonists’ lives and also keep their distance. Art is censored but is central to the main characters’ lives. Collective taxis create social cohesion but also social friction. A country bent on distancing itself from America but where artists cannot help but celebrate one of its best stories and playwrights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, this film is another in Farhadi’s growing list of understated, beautifully captured, literary and empathic films about contemporary Iranian life. &lt;em&gt;A Separation&lt;/em&gt; remains one of my all time favorites. &lt;em&gt;The Salesman&lt;/em&gt; probably doesn’t break that mark, but it is a commendable film about marriage, art, society and punishment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like some others, I came back to rewatch this after seeing &lt;a href=&quot;http://letterboxd.com/samarthbhaskar/film/split-2016/&quot;&gt;Split&lt;/a&gt; this week. After the last 6-8 years of superhero movies, I think we should give M. Night credit for pre-empting this genre with a great superhero entry. The premise – what if superheroes were already here, living among us, they just didn’t know – is fascinating. And this film sees it through to great success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bruce Willis also turned in a great performance here. From the first scene in the train to one of the final scenes at the breakfast table with his son, the development of his inner life his just as intersting as his transition into superhero.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;M. Night Shyamalan should stick to films of this size. His ambitions match his talents well here. Bigger budget films like &lt;em&gt;Avatar&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Happening&lt;/em&gt; just aren’t as well suited for him. The pleasures of his camera tricks, framing and blocking, and suspense built through highly interior locations are better felt in films like &lt;em&gt;Split&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Unbreakable&lt;/em&gt; and, of course, &lt;em&gt;Sixth Sense&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The treatment of mental disorders and abuse left me wanting. And some of the acting by James McAvoy, which on the whole was impressive, was too campy even for a horror film like this. But overall, I was along for the ride, rooting for Anya Taylor-Joy, and a sucker for the twist at the end.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Small Great Things</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I read Roxanne Gay’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/16/books/review/jodi-picoult-small-great-things-roxane-gay.html?&quot;&gt;review&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;em&gt;Small Great Things&lt;/em&gt; in the New York Times Book Review before reading the book. After reading the book, I largely agree. This is a book largely written for a white audience, one that doesn’t engage with race and racism in America in any advanced or complicated way regularly. Jodi Picoult even says so much in her author’s note at the end of the book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then the question becomes, what do I, as a non-white American, who reads about and thinks about race regularly, have to gain from reading this book? I’ve come to the conclusion that there are two possible answers to this. One, I enjoyed reading the book. Although it is less literary (in terms of writing complexity, nuance, use of symbolism and other literary techniques) than my usual fare, the book is entertaining and fun to read. The pace of action, character building and forward momentum made short work of 400+ pages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other possible answer is that I can have all the nuanced, advanced ideas or discussions about race I want with myself or people like me, but it is of little consequence if I’m thinking and talking inside my own safe space. To properly address this conversation, I need to know how other people think, talk and write about this topic. Picoult’s work here represents a journey she went on. My own journey was different from hers. And her readers’ journeys will be different still. But in order for these conversations to progress, we must at least start with common experiences. Reading this book is my attempt at one example of this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So yes, as Gay says in her review, hopefully future work by Picoult in this vein will be “compelling for the rest of us,” but I found the experience of reading this book rewarding as an exercise in reading and a way to understand how conversations about race are shaped among people not like me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Little Men&lt;/em&gt; has a literary quality about it. While watching the film, I felt more like I was reading a short story in an anthology about childhood in America, or growing up in NYC. Those types of short stories are popular in magazines like the New Yorker or in compilations that come out at every year. Which is to say, I’m pretty familiar with the genre and the characters that usually show up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are also films like &lt;em&gt;Wolfpack&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Frances Ha&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;One Fine Day&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Kids&lt;/em&gt; that capture some parts of that experience. But there was something singular about this film. Perhaps because it took up the topic of gentrification in Brooklyn (my place of residence). Perhaps because the setting was so contemporary, although surprisingly missing computer/phone mediated communication almost entirely from the plot. Whatever the reason, I really enjoyed the understated, quiet, but realistically dramatic nature of this film. Greg Kinnear, Paulina Garcia, and the two young protagonists all put in great performances. And Ira Sachs’ writing and directing choices put together a wonderful package, well worth investing a couple of hours into.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Children of Men</title>

&lt;p&gt;This movie is truly a masterpiece. The writing, the cinematography, set and costume design, the camera work, lighting, action sequences, music, framing, use of background, intertextual artistic references, emotion management, almost every element of this film is executed to the highest degree. A couple of times, like in &lt;em&gt;Gravity&lt;/em&gt; (with Sandra Bullock’s natal, umbilical, floating shot) the symbology (especially the Jesus/Christianity stuff) is a little too on the nose for my liking, but that is hardly worth complaining about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On this viewing, I couldn’t help but think about how prescient this movie is. 2016 really marks the beginning of its time. Themes related to refugees, climate and government failure, the lack of imagination on the part of our leaders, and the turn toward nationalism and militarism are brilliantly constructed. I found myself thinking, over and over again, about how all the things I know about society, public policy, community building, all basically fall apart if there’s no future to live for. And unlike other science fiction, where the near-future is threatened, this film denies its characters the middle-distance or far-distance future. I don’t think I’ve ever encountered a story where life still goes on, knowing that the clock is counting down for humanity. So much of current social cohesion takes for granted the idea that tomorrow is coming. But perhaps this is the ultimate lesson of this film – that we are currently living in a world where tomorrow (whether through climate change, or some other man made or natural disaster) is not guaranteed, we just refuse to accept it.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Michael Chabon’s authorial distance from the narrator of this book, Mike, is at hard to discern. Chabon, reportedly, had a similar experience as his narrator, talking with this grandfather on his death bed in the late 1980s. It seems he used this experience as a jumping point to write this novel. Chabon’s patented ornate, technically proficient writing is on display in this book. I happened to listen to it as an audio-book (something I don’t do often), and the words are even more pleasurable as speech. But sometimes this talent and embellishment gets in the way of what’s most important: the story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I never felt emotionally connected or moved by this book. There was plenty of emotionality throughout, sadness, humor, shock, and so on. But, perhaps because of the balance between plot and character, or because the central character is a man from a generation that has been written about so much and afflicted by many of the same characteristics (stoic, silent, etc), or because stories about rockets, WWII, and family mysteries are not interesting on their own, I ended up finding myself impressed with the writing, but not lost in the story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a recent book club discussion about this book, a 5 person group split 3 (all the men) in favor of this book. And 2 (the women) against it. I found this distribution interesting too. Perhaps in the same way as the literary ancestors of this book (Pynchon and Salinger) are seen, Chabon has created a deeply masculine book, in a time when our culture has moved past such literature.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://letterboxd.com/samarthbhaskar/film/13th/&quot;&gt;LetterboxD review link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ava Duvernay’s argument in this film is indebted to Michelle Alexander, Ta-nehisi Coates, Skip Gates, Brian Stevenson, Khalil Gibran Muhammad, Angela Davis, Cornell West and many others. Thankfully, almost every one of these writers and intellectuals is on screen in this film. Using the 13th Amendment, especially a middle phrase (“ except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted”) as a framing device was a genius way to construct this argument from the ground up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to these words, Duvernay uses lyrics, pictures, news footage, straight-to-camera interviews, and other traditional tools of documentary to construct a compelling narrative about mass incarceration, black subjugation and abuses of policing power by the state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The foils she picks, mostly people like Grover Norquist, Newt Gingrich and a board member of ALEC, are less compelling. My bias is always toward nuance and complication, but some arguments are clear cut. The other side of this argument, perhaps, is just not nearly as compelling. The way criminal justice works in our country is broken, unfair, and immoral.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Other People&lt;/em&gt;, although full of fine moments (especially the final scenes), and fine acting, never really broke its “trying-overly-hard to be an indie film” quality for me. I was reminded of a line in Noah Baumbach’s &lt;em&gt;Frances Ha&lt;/em&gt; when Sophie, Frances’ best friend, enters an apartment and remarks something like “it’s just that this apartment is very…aware of itself.” I felt similarly about this film. David, the protagonist, is aware of himself, which is a fine quality to ascribe to a character and Jesse Plemmons plays it well. But it’s not a quality you want from the film altogether.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I re-watched &lt;em&gt;Garden State&lt;/em&gt; a couple of years ago. I hadn’t seen it since its release in 2004. I couldn’t even finish the film because I found it so hyper-aware of itself. Every line of dialog sounded like it was written by a pre-teen who had just discovered The Perks of Being a Wallflower. &lt;em&gt;Other People&lt;/em&gt; was not as excruciating a watch, but some of the same qualities kept me from fully connecting with the film, its characters, and its story.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Hisham Matar’s memoir came across my radar during the end of 2016, when publications were printing and promoting their best-of-year lists. The Middle East is a region about which I have read and learned plenty, but Libya has always been under-represented. After reading a short excerpt and finding myself impressed with his writing style – prose marked by economical word choice, sharp, incisive voice, and a high-minded, lyrical, literary quality – I jumped into the book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I finished &lt;em&gt;The Return&lt;/em&gt; quickly across two travel days, a perfect context given Matar’s own traveling plot devices throughout. While the action and plotting were gripping in and of themselves, I felt even more rewarded for the picture of Libya that Matar painted. Learning about his family, their intellectual and political work, their experiences dealing with Qadafi’s authoritarian regime and their time in prison, built for me a vision of Libya I’ve never found elsewhere. I imagine Hisham’s father would be proud of his son, if for no other reason, for how he has carried forward the intellectual tradition of his family and his country. So the world can see how much culture, tradition and beauty Libya and its sons and daughters contain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I immediately recommended the book to other friends who I knew would find the writing to be of the highest quality, the story to be gripping, and the depiction of Libya and Matar’s family fascinating.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Celeste Ng, I assume, borrowed heavily from her life for this book. The relationships between siblings, Lydia’s relationship with her parents, and the life of an over-worked, high achieving, high schooler are among the best parts of this book. Ng’s writing is approachable, but not so easy as to lull your attention away. From the first sentence, the ambitions of this literary thriller are clear. What unfolds, though, over the course of the book is less thriller (I was always interested in finding out what happened to Lydia, but that wasn’t my sole interest) and more family drama.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The family, then, is also worth addressing. This book contains some great descriptions of mixed families, women’s fight for a broader identity than home maker, Asian American identity formation and its strained but undivorceable relationship with academia in America, as well as the dynamics of being a non-traditional, non-white family in small town America. All of these elements raised my appreciation for the book. But with almost every single one of them, there were times where Ng insisted on hitting me over the head with conflicts, or tensions, that were abundantly clear through her writing about characters or plot descriptions. I didn’t need to know, in explicit terms, what James meant when he gave a necklace to Lydia, or what Marilyn wanted from Lydia when she devoted so much time and energy into her academic success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, there is a lot to like about this book. It makes for a quick read, if nothing else. I look forward to more work by Ng, that explores similar themes, but perhaps (as others have said) through more showing and less telling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sacrifice is a major American value, especially in action movies. The last 45-minutes of this film beautifully capture the sacrifices made by its protagonists. The action is crisp. The shots are beautiful. The pacing is well calibrated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The irony, though, is that we must first sacrifice about 80-90 minutes of preamble and set up to get this reward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems the answer to “I wonder how Denzel Washington will adapt this incredible August Wilson play for the screen” is – exactly like a play. There are less than a handful of shots where the camera moves, where we get cuts and close-ups, or any sort of visual variety. However, what this movie lacks in visual poetry, it makes up for in acting and pathos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The denouement feels somewhat stretched and overly pregnant with a need for closure. But the overwhelming feeling I was left with was a heavy sorrow, for a man and a family who can’t quite expand beyond the space in which they’ve been placed.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, I saw one a new favorite film, Chan-wook Park’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://letterboxd.com/samarthbhaskar/film/the-handmaiden/&quot;&gt;The Handmaiden&lt;/a&gt;. Another Korean work, I was reminded of this movie the whole time I read &lt;em&gt;The Vegetarian&lt;/em&gt;. Like the film, this book is filled with beguiling scene setting, characters, plot and motivation that keep you guessing, and is, above all, a beautifully crafted story that keeps the audience wrapped in its tentacles (or perhaps its ivy) from start to finish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This slim novel, as slim as its protagonist, is set in three parts (a proven literary device) and told from three perspectives but the whole time your attention, empathy and interest are invested in the protagonist. We hardly get any of her thoughts or words, only a few italicized passages and conversations. But we go on a journey with her unlike any other. The journey is inward, through a maze of dreams, anxieties and breakdowns. No one in her life is equiped to help her. She might not even want help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This book also reminded me of one of my favorite 2016 reads, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1680087148?book_show_action=false&amp;amp;from_review_page=1&quot;&gt;An Unnecessary Woman&lt;/a&gt; by Rabih Alameddine. Through crisp writing, a fascinating female protagonist, and a journey inward, it reveals much about the world outside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were multiple points in this movie when I thought the sobbing and sniffling noises were part of the score. Or maybe they were diegetic sounds. Everyone in the theater was sobbing by the end of the movie. A bald-faced appeal to pathos is usually a recipe for eye-rolls, but this film largely earns the emotionality it wants from viewers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn’t expect as much of the movie to take place in India, perhaps because of the trailers or perhaps because other movies in this vein are quick to spend time in the West. But when the opening credits were rolling and I saw Indian name after Indian name, my intrigue rose. An hour into the movie, we still hadn’t left India, and I began to realize, this wasn’t the story I came in expecting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wasn’t the only person whose expectations were upended by this film. Dev Patel, in an interview given during this movie’s press cycle, remarked on how infrequently he gets roles where his inner life, his romantic life, and emotional variety are asked of him. This wasn’t a ground-breaking film but it avoided some pitfalls it could’ve fallen down. We still get to know the white mother much more than the Indian mother. We still get a lead actor who looks nothing like the man the film is based on. But we’re getting closer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has been a busy end-of-2016 at the movies. Catching up with &lt;em&gt;Barry&lt;/em&gt; on a small screen, via Netflix, added needed variety into the mix. The film, small, contained, a brief slice-of-life, was nice to watch at home instead of at the theater. I’ve always felt a sense of closeness to Barack Obama. At home, in my own small New York space, was the right context.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One way to watch &lt;em&gt;Barry&lt;/em&gt; is to wonder what the film would be like if the main character didn’t go on to become a 2-term president of the most powerful country in history. In that scenario, we get a portrait of a young man, quiet, pensive, introspective, figuring out his place in a big world. Barry feels out of place in his environment, in his relationships, in his friendships, at parties. Perhaps the basketball court is the only place where he can totally be himself. When asked about who he is, where he’s from - the most basic of questions we ask when we meet someone new - he’s unsure of how to capture himself in a few words. He has lived around the world. His experiences and interests are not easy to summarize. He wants to convey more than he can say in a normal conversation. These are feelings with which I can empathize.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a man who would go on to become a gifted orator, politician and leader, &lt;em&gt;Barry&lt;/em&gt; depicts him unable to express himself in words. But we know he will find himself. His path will zig-zag, but he will end up discovering his whole self. Ultimately, &lt;em&gt;Barry&lt;/em&gt; is successful as a biopic because it carries the weight of what’s not on screen. The book he will write. The woman he will marry. The life he will lead. The weight of all of this is present in this portrait.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Steve Martin’s biography-not-autobiography is a breezy, quick read. I grew up knowing Martin as more Hollywood dad than avant-garde standup comic, so much of the material in this book was new to me. This book sails when Martin is being candid and honest about his family life, his time on the road, and his formative years a performer. Much like his comedy (which I’ve seen mostly on Youtube), there’s something stripped down about Martin’s writing. His sentences are not complex, his writing is not lyrical, his insights are not deep. What you get, mostly, are reflections and stories about an extraordinary life lived by an ordinary man.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://letterboxd.com/samarthbhaskar/film/in-the-mood-for-love/&quot;&gt;LetterboxD review link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I saw &lt;em&gt;In The Mood For Love&lt;/em&gt;, for the first time, on a whim a few years ago. I was just starting to get into films, hadn’t seen many art-house films, and only a few foreign ones. I fell in love with this movie almost immediately. And have counted it among one of my favorites for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve re-watched it a few times since, the most recent was as a part of a Wong Kar-wai retrospective at the Metrograph theater in NYC. Seeing it in conjunction with &lt;em&gt;2046&lt;/em&gt; made some of the plot points jump out in a way I hadn’t considered before. But more than anything else, it reminded me of the powerful way Wong can elicit a mood or feeling from a viewer purely through the use of images. The story is compelling as ever, and the actors deserve much of the credit for the success of this film, but it is Wong’s directing, framing and cinematography that really makes this film soar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shots that frame each character within a frame, make us complicit in the way the characters feel watched, while we do the watching, and they struggle to find a way to live as their full selves. The claustrophobia of tiny Hong Kong rooms, hallways, and alleyways add to the sense that these characters can never fully release themselves, never live full lives without fear of bumping into something, knocking it off a shelf.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The purity of Mr. Chow and Mrs. Chan’s courtship and love is lifted directly from a past time but because Wong and his actors believe so fully in the story, it is sold to us in a genuine but updated way. I felt similarly, recently, about &lt;em&gt;La La Land&lt;/em&gt;, and its central relationship. Cliché is dangerous, and no other topic is as susceptible to it as love. But when we have an authentic exploration of themes around love, created through top notch acting, story-telling, editing and direction, clichés are easily avoided.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;2046&lt;/em&gt;, for better or for worse, will always exist in comparison to &lt;em&gt;In The Mood For Love&lt;/em&gt;, and to a lesser extent, “Days of Being Wild”. This probably clouds any reviewers ability to fully consider the film on its own. It also doesn’t help that Wong Kar-wai made &lt;em&gt;2046&lt;/em&gt; as a beguiling, moody, story-within-a-story-within-a-story, series of vignettes, that are difficult to understand as a whole but intriguing to consider each on its own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, any sort of narrative description or explication of this film’s plot, likely misses the point. Wong is, like the greatest film-makers of our time, primarily interested in using visuals, images, composition and colors to tell stories, not words. The visual vocabulary, including elements of noir, slow-motion used to great effect, set and costume design that deserves an exploration all its own, and framing of the characters to highlight their inner lives is paired with story telling that jumps around in time (like memory) and is guided by a narrator (who changes identity part way through the film) to create a challenging, but rewarding film-viewing experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, &lt;em&gt;2046&lt;/em&gt; falls slightly short of the incredibly high mark set by &lt;em&gt;In The Mood For Love&lt;/em&gt;. But that is hardly any reason to diminish the accomplishments of this film. Wong Kar-wai is a masterful visual artist, film-maker and story-teller.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pablo Larraín has accomplished a masterful feat, with the help of Natalie Portman. They have retold a story so familiar to us, but in a way that creates a new sculpture out of the same clay. As Matt Zoller Seitz &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/jackie-2016&quot;&gt;writes&lt;/a&gt; over at rogerebert.com, there are two movies in this movie. One, about myth-making, personal ambition and maintenance of power in the face of adversity. The other, about a woman reluctantly shot into the national spotlight after the violent murder of her husband, working as hard as she can to keep composure, attend to her family, and avoid the undoing of her husband’s legacy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is said sometimes, about films, that if something isn’t on the page, it won’t make it on to the screen. But Portman’s acting is so good in this film, that we get a vocabulary entirely made of facial expressions, gestures, movements, and body composition that exceeds anything that could be written on a page. I haven’t read the script, but I can only imagine the gap that exists between a scene that might say “Jackie, crying, removes blood from her face, cleans up before facing others on Air Force One” and how that scene actually plays in the film. All the additional meaning that is created is a credit to Portman’s performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately this is a post-modern, aesthetically minded, biopic. It probably won’t work for all audiences. But I found it a great exegesis of a myth that already exists in our heads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It wasn’t the poetic words of Baldwin, the masterful narration by Jackson or the brilliant film-making and editing choices made by Raoul Peck that got to me in &lt;em&gt;I am not your Negro&lt;/em&gt;. It was one particular sequence, near the end, where in close proximity to one another we see images of lynchings, and then images of young slave children from antebellum America, and then images of modern day black Americans set to swelling music. This sequence comes after 80 minutes of footage, words, music and description of Baldwin’s view of the world and the civil rights movement. And, for me, it completely collapsed any academic or viewing distance I had as a viewer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve spent many hours watching YouTube clips of Baldwin at the Cambridge debate or on the Dick Cavett show, or reading his novels and criticism, so some of this material was familiar to me. But much of this film, his letters to his agent, his responses to the death of Medger Evers, Malcom X and Martin Luther King, and others were new to me. One of the biggest triumphs is how well all this source material is constructed into an argument. This is no Ken Burns documentary. There is a strong, and clear perspective at its core. It is resolute in its purpose. And as a result, we get a new artifact from Baldwin, posthumously, that can be added to his oeuvre, and stand next to some of his best work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Samuel Jackson, after doing much damage to the image of the black man in mainstream film, could do well to spend his remaining time in Hollywood working on projects like this. Where his talents aren’t filtered directly into an angry character, but instead he can become someone akin to Harry Belafonte or even Sidney Poitier. It would, in my opinion, be a great way to cash in all the capital he has built as a star in his career.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;If you’ve read any reviews or talked to readers of this book, you’ve likely heard about the good and bad parts of this book. The bad news is, it’s true. The sections of this book dealing with Aimee, set in west Africa, are just not good. They’re well written, because Smith, if nothing else, is a sharp writer. But the story, the message, the intellectual force behind them is no match for the other half of this book. The half that tells the story of the narrator and her childhood friend Tracey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To (attempt to) put a finer point it: the sections based in west Africa (Gambia, likely), come off unfeeling and demonstrative of Smith’s thoughts about foreign aid, international development and Western investment in developing countries. They seem keen on demonstrating the breadth of her knowledge and thoughts about these things. Rather than diving deeper into the lives of these characters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The depth of feeling, description and exploration of the other half of the book (largely based in London and New York) is what helps it succeed. Smith’s love of dance and music (apparent in other works, but mostly through biographical details about her own upbringing), her descriptions of familial and close friend relationhips, London in the 1980s and 1990s, culture, and housing are much more vivid, felt, and betray a deeper intellectual command. These sections, in no uncertain terms, save this book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will always show up for Zadie Smith’s writing. Her future books, her non-fiction essays, her cultural commentary. I find her mind sharp, her use of language impressive, and her perspective important as a voice of the generation just before mine.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">[LetterboxD review link](http://letterboxd.com/samarthbhaskar/film/nocturnal-animals/)

Tom Ford&#39;s latest, &lt;em&gt;Nocturnal Animals&lt;/em&gt;, has many biographical elements. Himself a Texas born-and-raised artist, now at the top of cultural and elite circles; I imagine Ford is coming to the point in his life when he tries to put it all together for himself. Ambition can create a sort of tunnel vision, and after you&#39;ve achieved as much as he has, you can take a moment to look back and tell your own story to yourself.

The story, here, is not entirely autobiographical, but it is gripping. Lucid writing, paired with sharp editing, and aided by solid performances (especially from Michael Shannon), created a tense atmosphere throughout the film. The back-and-forth, flashback, present-tense conceit, where imagination and reality are distorted into each other, worked to keep me engaged and interested in the whole film. No dramatization of reading a book should be this thrilling to watch.

Ultimately, what&#39;s missing in moralism or message, is made up for through entertainment, aestheticism and stylization. The controversial ending, though I&#39;m sure frustrating to many, did not leave me wanting. I enjoyed the ride enough to not worry so much about the result.</content>

&lt;p&gt;In this political season, there’s been a lot of discussion of the American identity, especially American maleness. I didn’t go into &lt;em&gt;Manchester by the Sea&lt;/em&gt; expecting an exploration of maleness, or white maleness, but that’s the biggest thing I got out of it. Afterward, reading reviews and comments on the film, I’ve noticed, that the film seems to have struck a chord among white male critics in particular.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lee Chandler, played superbly by Casey Affleck, is a laconic man, bound up in his emotions, but unable to connect through communication. The result is not only that he creates distance between himself and those trying to get through to him, but that his immediate environment is marked by tension and agita. Men, in particular, who have this affect end up creating this atmosphere around them, often without realizing it. The brooding, constant drinking (for numbness perhaps, but perhaps also as an effort to lubricate emotionality or words out of themselves), and feeling wound up so tightly is a particularly male trait. Perhaps even a particularly American male trait. There’s a cultural history to be written about this personality going back to John Wayne, through Archie Bunker, to Clint Eastwood and on. It is a trait exacerbated by the weight of performative maleness and one that most American men probably won’t willingly give up, choosing to fight and lash out at the possibility of change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone around Lee, his nephew, ex-wife, former sister-in-law, even his very-American-brother, tries and fails to get through to him. The greatest sadness, I think, is that there will likely come a day, when he is old and alone, when he will realize that he could have changed. He could have stopped trying so hard to keep things bottled up, let himself fall apart a little, and brought love into his atmosphere and received love in return. Kenneth Lonergan (quickly rising on my list of favorite directors, if for no other reason than his incredible grasp of teenage life) gives us a glimpse of this change near the end of this film. But whether this change comes for Lee is anything but inevitable.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Trevor Noah’s standup comedy has always been impressive. From seeing clips of him as a rising star in South Africa, to seeing him around the NYC standup circuit, I always found his perspective funny, well-argued and refreshing. But as they say, in the land of the blind, the one-eyed man is king. Or else, among comedians trying to tell jokes, bringing even a little wisdom and political acuity can make you seem wiser than you actually are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In his turn as host of the Daily Show, these flaws have started to show a little more. His recent, viral, interview with Tomi Lahren, for example, betrayed not a fully formed world view, political acumen, and strong perspective, but a smug, dismissive tone that seemed self-congratulatory, ready to accept the lauding of an audience who was already ready to agree with him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of that is preamble, to say, that although his book &lt;em&gt;Born a Crime&lt;/em&gt; is full of great stories, and even decent writing at times, it is not literary, wise or deeply thought. All of this is fine, he’s an entertainer, his targets are usually not sophisticated readers of literary writing, but some of the discussion of this book made it seem (at least to me) like a deeper exploration of race, class, immigration and identity than what I found in these pages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One example that captures this feeling, for me, was his discussion of his name. He says his mom named him this because it means nothing, she wanted for him a blank slate, a future that he could shape from his own molding. This is clearly not the case. A quick google search reveals that Trevor, like any name, has an etymology. It may not be grounded in South African culture, but it exists. Instead of stopping where he stopped in this line of thought, he could have pressed a step further, exploring what it meant for his mom, a black woman (who is the most fascinating part of this book), to marry a black man, name her colored child a European name. There is a whole line of thought waiting to be dug up there that’s left untouched.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I probably sound harsher than I intend. My aim is to mostly warn people who may approach this book after its inclusion on best-of lists, and its favorable reviews, expecting something that isn’t there.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Re-reading a novel is a rare thing for me. When I was young, before I was a book lover, I used to re-read the &lt;em&gt;Autobiography of Lee Iococca&lt;/em&gt;. I don’t know why. It was just a book my mom picked up at some book sale once, to use as filler on an empty book shelf at home. I picked it up and became fascinated by this old white man who invented the modern minivan, saved Chrysler, and captured the country’s attention in the mid-80s. We didn’t have many other books in the house (except a tattered copy of Norman Mailer’s The Naked and the Dead, which I didn’t dare read because it had the word “naked” on the cover), so I re-read Iococca a couple of times a year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since then, I can’t remember re-reading a book. But I picked up An Equal Music again, off my bookshelf, earlier this month. The reason, unclear at the time but clearer now in hindsight, is because I saw a movie called &lt;a href=&quot;http://letterboxd.com/samarthbhaskar/film/blue-jay-2016/&quot;&gt;Blue Jay&lt;/a&gt; recently and it really resonated with me. It reminded me of an old high school relationship. It evoked similar feelings as when I first read this book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The relationship between Michael and Julia, and the masterful writing about classical music, come together wonderfully in this book. Vikram Seth’s writing and evocation of emotion is the most attractive part of this book for me. The plot, alone, is nothing remarkable or ground-breaking. But the way it is carried out through these characters and writing elevates this book from another romantic drama into something greater.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kicked off by &lt;em&gt;Blue Jay&lt;/em&gt; and rounded out by this re-read, I enjoyed this jaunt down memory lane, reconnecting with nostalgic romanticism from my past. In a time marked by upheavel and feeling unmoored because of cultural and political change, it was nice to reconnect with these old feelings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was a re-watch for me, almost 10 years after the film’s release, when I had seen it first. Cronenberg’s usual fascination with the intersection of the corporal and people’s identities is front and center. The bath house fight scene was fresh in my memory, even though I had only seen the film once before. There’s something about those curved knives, how sharp they are, and how they scrape against Vigo Mortenson’s body, that is unforgettable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The thing that I didn’t remember but appreciated on this rewatch, was the relationship between the lone Londoner (Naomi Watts, an anglicized second generation immigrant herself), and the immigrant communities in London. In the last few years, as a resident of Brooklyn, I’ve come to know some of these communities myself. I find them fascinating. And ripe with narrative tension and structure, ready to explore. I’d be happy to read and watch more stories with communities like London’s Russian neighborhoods and the mob at their center.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another thing I noticed, was how simple the whole plot and story was. There weren’t many twists and turns. The plot, especially if you’ve seen other films in the mob genre, folds out mostly as expected. The real rewards of watching this film come from a deeper exploration of the main protagonists’ motivations. Which are less clear on screen or in dialog but brought out mostly through great acting.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;One of my favorite quotes about meritocracy is one I heard from Ben Bernanke a few years ago, when he gave a commencement address at Princeton:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“A meritocracy is a system in which the people who are the luckiest in their health and genetic endowment; luckiest in terms of family support, encouragement, and, probably, income; luckiest in their educational and career opportunities; and luckiest in so many other ways difficult to enumerate — these are the folks who reap the largest rewards. The only way for even a putative meritocracy to hope to pass ethical muster, to be considered fair, is if those who are the luckiest in all of those respects also have the greatest responsibility to work hard, to contribute to the betterment of the world, and to share their luck with others.” - Ben Bernanke, Princeton commencement speech&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The central conceit of this book, that meritocracy is a broken system, and that elites use it to rise up the ladder but then turn around and pull the ladder up behind them, entrenching their power, creating a more and more unequal system, reminded me of this quote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My attention was brought to this book on election night, when I saw an NYT colleague tweet something like “Years ago when I read Chris Hayes’ Twilight of the Elite, I thought he was misguided. Now I think he may have just been ahead of the curve.” In an effort to make sense of the world as it was changing around me that night, I ordered the book immediately. What I got as I devoured the book in 2 quick sittings, was a compelling (if sometimes scattered) argument about the fall of the American ideal of meritocracy. Hayes, while rightly identifying his own place in elite circles (I contend with my place in these circles all the time, it’s not an easy task), goes through a few examples (MLB, politics, economics, Catholicism, Occupy Wall Street) of institutional failure, laying groundwork for the main argument.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like many such arguments made in the last 10-15 years, Occupy Wall Street is held up as an example of a movement or institution that avoided some of these pitfalls. Every time I see Occupy Wall Street held up as a model, I’m a bit confused. By most measures, it was a failed movement. You can draw through-lines on its influence on subsequent movements like the Bernie Sanders’ bid for the presidency, Black Lives Matter, but I’m hard pressed to see how Occupy could be considered a success. But that’s only a small quibble, with an otherwise well-reasoned book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most useful aspect of this book, and this is something that has gained popularity in recent weeks with all the post-election analyses that have been published, is the mental model of an American split between elites and non-elites. Splits along this axis, among other axes like rural/urban, conservative/liberal, educated/non-educated, white/non-white, are a helpful rubric when drawing mental models of how and why people make political decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Elle&lt;/em&gt; has a lot of things going for it. Not the least of which is Isabelle Huppert at her acting and artistic crest. This material, about sexuality and power, but also about family, aging, guilt and taboo, in a lesser actor’s hands could’ve withered and fallen apart. Huppert, in conjunction with Verhoeven, instead create a complex, compelling exploration of the role of power in sexual violence and sexuality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an earlier film, Catherine Breillat’s &lt;em&gt;Abuse of Weakness&lt;/em&gt;, Huppert explores some similar themes. In that film, I contend, she is working through an even more complex, fascinating character, in part because it is a depiction of real events.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve come to expect greatness from Huppert (much like her French compatriot Juliette Binoche) every time she is on screen. I was not disappointed this time.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://letterboxd.com/samarthbhaskar/film/loving-2016/&quot;&gt;LetterboxD review link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I saw &lt;em&gt;Loving&lt;/em&gt; only a few days after the election of Donald Trump. So the over-bearing political news cycle colored my viewing of the film (hell, it is coloring my view of the world) more than I would like. But in a political season marked by unease, hyperbole and despair, this film was a welcomed reprieve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nichols (who couldn’t help but give Michael Shannon at least a little bit of screen time) chose to dramatize this story with little dialog. With its muted tones, quiet action and focus on the two main characters, the politics of this film were brought into focus. The story of Richard and Mildred Loving is not one of heroes, stances, or protests. But one of normalcy, a desire to focus on family, and dignity in the face of adversity. The patience this family displayed in its years-long journey through the legal system is something progressives should take seriously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This isn’t among my favorite of Nichols’ work (&lt;em&gt;Take Shelter&lt;/em&gt; still reigns supreme for me), partially because the pacing is so stayed it sometimes congeals and lacks forward momentum. But a few moments, largely because of Ruth Negga’s performance, and the overall story and message are worth the price of admission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sing Street&lt;/em&gt;, much like its older sibling &lt;em&gt;Once&lt;/em&gt;, succeeds largely because of the quality of its music. It draws from 80’s pop and rock, and is a great introduction or reminiscence of the discographies of bands like The Cure, The Smiths, Duran Duran and David Bowie. If it wasn’t for the high quality musicality, this movie would be much less enjoyable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other key ingredient in this film is its lead, Ferdia Walsh-Peelo. He is able to manage dynamics of emotions asked of his character, with openness, charisma and confidence. This mix of emotionality and conviction serves his character and the ethos of the film well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Once&lt;/em&gt; had better story-telling, a tighter inner-world, and fewer loose ends in its plot. But &lt;em&gt;Sing Street&lt;/em&gt; is no slouch in comparison.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of my favorite things about Denis Villeneuve’s films, including &lt;em&gt;Incendies&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Sicario&lt;/em&gt;, and now &lt;em&gt;Arrival&lt;/em&gt; are full, dynamic, strong female protagonists. In each film, Villeneuve puts his faith in a central character who is good at her job, but is weighed by heavy emotion. However, instead of the character crumbling under the weight of these emotions, or turning her attention entirely to her inner life, his protagonists always deal with both aspects - the inner lives, and the action - admirably. This is combined with great actors (Amy Adams and Emily Blunt are good, but Lubna Azabal is in a class her own) and beautiful cinematography that brings these characters to life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The stakes in &lt;em&gt;Arrival&lt;/em&gt; are less high than &lt;em&gt;Incendies&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Sicario&lt;/em&gt;, and the balance of the story (mostly true to Ted Chiang’s source material) tends toward the cosmic or the universal rather than the personal, but the film is still impactful. If I had to level and complaints, it would be about the pacing of the 2nd third of the film. It sags slightly and loses some of the momentum built in the first act. The third act, however, mostly makes up for this. The wonderful sound and set design also help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The film has the added benefit of being based on great science fiction. Instead of relying on machismo (&lt;em&gt;The Martian&lt;/em&gt;), grit (&lt;em&gt;Mad Max: Fury Road&lt;/em&gt;), or mysticism (&lt;em&gt;Midnight Special&lt;/em&gt;) for meaning, Chiang uses the wonders of rationalism and scientific inquiry to imbue meaning into his work. I find this sub-genre of sci-fi more compelling than its counterparts. What other writers are taking esoteric academic disciplines like linguistics and cognitive science to develop beautiful, rich, humanistic stories? And conveying enough technical detail to both bring along the reader/viewer but also not condescend to us.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>La La Land</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://letterboxd.com/samarthbhaskar/film/la-la-land/&quot;&gt;LetterboxD review link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I was a kid, I couldn’t watch action movies too late in the evening because I’d get too riled up, bouncing off walls practicing my fake martial arts moves. &lt;em&gt;La La Land&lt;/em&gt; had this effect on me. I came out of the theater, wanting to bounce off walls, singing and dancing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I loved &lt;em&gt;Whiplash&lt;/em&gt;, partially because of my love for jazz. That story, about a young, ambitious, musician felt grounded in Chazelle’s experience coming into himself as a young artist. &lt;em&gt;La La Land&lt;/em&gt;, then, is the continuation of his artistic journey. Chazelle and his musical partner, Justin Hurwitz, love jazz. And they want others to love it too. This is a feeling I share with them. But unlike Seb, I’ve never been so presumptuous to think I can convert someone into a jazz lover. What I lack in jazz talent, Seb/Hurwitz/Chazelle possess in spades as musicians and film-makers. It excites me to imagine years of collaborations between them, if for no other reason, to get more lovely jazz music from their soundtracks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The film itself, is not overly didactic or moralistic. It’s a rather simple exploration of the tension between love and ambition. About the compromises (like those that jazz musicians make on stage) that young artists have to make to realize their dreams. What &lt;em&gt;Spotlight&lt;/em&gt; did for me last year through moralistic, intellectual, story-telling, this film did through aesthetic, romantic, story-telling. It reminded me of my love for, and the power of, good film-making. No 2 well-made films will capture an audience using the same methods. There are infinite ways to tell a story well. Chazelle and Hurwitz found magic with this version of this story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the half of this country that has been feeling destitute and cynical for the last month, this movie is a lovely way to re-light your inner candle. As ever, the best antidote to hopelessness is authenticity. This isn’t a perfect movie, but we don’t love things because they’re perfect.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This book - a dark, twisty, uncomfortable, at times gripping, at times confusing read - is probably not for everyone. I read it in a time when I was not dealing with direct grief or processing loss, but I can imagine that in the future when I find myself in such a place, I will return to this book, to match my inner mood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a reader, I take a risk when I pick up experimental works like this. These risks don’t always pay off. This one didn’t pay off fully, but I did gain something from reading it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What &lt;em&gt;Carol&lt;/em&gt; might have been if Marquis de Sade had written it. I was so enamored by the set design, photography, acting, and (sometimes hard to follow) dialog of this film that the twists and turns almost all caught me by surprise. Which is really the kind of high from good story telling and film-making that made me fall in love with it in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the extended sex scenes felt over-indulgent, a feeling that reminded me of &lt;em&gt;Blue is the Warmest Color&lt;/em&gt;. Unlike &lt;em&gt;Blue&lt;/em&gt;, though, there was something more sinister about the depiction of female love here. It felt more “male-gazy,” but was not so bad as to be entirely off putting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, this film represents a major accomplishment for Park Chan Wook, whose &lt;em&gt;Oldboy&lt;/em&gt; has appropriately been canonized in the world of thrillers (while &lt;em&gt;Stoker&lt;/em&gt; was less successful). He pulls off a masterful story, keeping his audience rapt the whole way through, as if in the tentacles of some sort of highly literate octopus.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;&quot;&gt;LetterboxD review link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There have been a few movies in recent years that I have described, to myself or others, as atmospheric. &lt;em&gt;Neon Demon&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Under the Skin&lt;/em&gt; come to mind. I will add &lt;em&gt;Moonlight&lt;/em&gt; to this list. That they all achieve some part of this “atmospheric-ness” through sexuality is probably not a coincidence. But sexuality is realized very differently across these films, not least because sexuality for their protagonists means something completely different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During and after this film, it took me some time to shake a feeling of uneasiness. Every corner Chiron turned, I feared for him. His world-view, his sense of discomfort in his skin as a young man, and his constant vigilance, even in his own home, was telegraphed perfectly by the director. As a viewer, I was never at ease, and that’s how I imagine Chiron felt throughout his life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I read this cliche often, about literature, film, and art altogether - “the universal is in the specific.” &lt;em&gt;Moonlight&lt;/em&gt; is a shining example of this maxim. By telling the story of this one man’s life, building this character from child, to teenager, to adult, we get an exploration of masculinity, race, sexuality, family and creation of self that will stand for ages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, don’t miss the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.npr.org/2016/10/19/498395257/for-films-creators-moonlight-provided-space-to-explore-a-painful-past&quot;&gt;Fresh Air&lt;/a&gt; interview with Barry Jenkins and Tarell McCraney. It’s the best companion piece to this film I’ve come across.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://letterboxd.com/samarthbhaskar/film/tampopo/&quot;&gt;LetterboxD review link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a long week &lt;em&gt;Tampopo&lt;/em&gt; was exactly what I needed. An irreverent, self-aware, romp, mashing genres, references and characters together to create a specifically Japanese, but universally lovable film. I attended a restored 4K screening of this film at Film Forum in NYC, where Nobuko Miyamoto was in attendence for a Q&amp;amp;A afterward. Her charm, still apparent 30 years after this film came out, and love for the filmmaker Juzo Itami were on full display. Seeing the film in a full-house, with everyone laughing and enjoying every delictable moment, was an added bonus - not dissimilar from seeing &lt;em&gt;Toni Erdmann&lt;/em&gt; in a packed theater earlier this fall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s a small moment between Goro and Tampopo, in (where else) a restaurant that struck me. The film, as a whole, is hardly vulnerable, rarely opting for emotion over plot or a joke, but in this moment the two protagonists share some of their life story with each other. Goro says something to the effect of: “I grew up in a miserable family, I never learned how to act in a happy family when I became a father.” In a failm so focused on art, food, feminism, cultural references and so on, it was a particularly salient moment to see a character display his vulnerabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When directors talk about collaborating with actors to make a film, I have a hard time imagining what that means. Perhaps because I mostly take writers to be vessels for the words and direction, I’ve never quite wrapped my head around famed actor/director collaborations like DiCaprio/Scorcese, Soderbergh/Damon, Wright/Pegg, PTA/Seymour Hoffman.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seeing &lt;em&gt;Personal Shopper &lt;/em&gt; on the heels of last year’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://letterboxd.com/samarthbhaskar/film/clouds-of-sils-maria/&quot;&gt;Clouds of Sils Maria&lt;/a&gt;, Assayas seemed eager to collaborate again with Kristen Stewart. What actresses like Juliette Binoche and Isabelle Huppert have done for directors for decades, Stewart seemed to do for Assayas. Namely, inspire within him a creative spirit. At the screening I attended, he spoke of this desire, and how he wrote this film and was eager to share it with Stewart. She agreed to make the film, and what we get is a wonderful film about identity, technology, grief, and jealousy among other things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Identity, for both Stewart and Assayas, is an endlessly interesting topic, it seems. They played with the idea in Clouds and they play with it again here in Personal Shopper. I look forward to continuing collaborations between these two on topics like identity and whatever else strikes their creative interests.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Certain Women</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://letterboxd.com/samarthbhaskar/film/certain-women/&quot;&gt;LetterboxD review link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kelly Reichardt made some aesthetic and artistic choices that portray the morality of this film. Her use of the entire screen, often filling only the top or bottom corners while leaving the rest full of space, especially at the beginning, situated us, the audience, in the Western context. A place like Montana is characterized by space, expanse, distance and grandeur. A less adept film-maker might’ve used plot or dialog to make that point. But Reichardt uses the frame. It’s a powerful example of a director using everything in her toolbox to get the job done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, there are many shots in the film that feature the main characters, women of middle-America, in quietness or stillness. There’s a morality about their presence on screen. It’s hard to describe, but it mirrors the morality we associate with the open prairie states of the West. An attitude that seems to suggest “we’re here to do the hard work, we’re not going to complain, we’re not going to make a fuss of it, we’re just going to do the work.” There’s something subversive about seeing women portrayed in this manner. This is usually a morality reserved for cowboys or ranch hands (which one of the best characters in the film is), but here it’s present in every one of the main characters, the lawyer, the business-woman, the teacher.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I suppose that’s the morality that Reichardt finds most compelling as a working director in Hollywood today. She knows what she wants. She knows the people with whom she works best (in her Q&amp;amp;A after this film with Michelle Williams, it was clear the two share a warm, meaningful friendship). And she knows the kinds of characters she wants to depict on screen. Similar arguments have been made about other leading women on the national stage in recent months (I’m referring to Hillary Clinton, sorry to be obtuse). Maybe that’s an important lesson to learn. That the women in leading roles in institutions from politics, to Hollywood, to characters on screen must have a pragmatic mentality. That this is the kind of morality that will help America transition to the kind of place where we have women in leadership roles, setting examples, and being embraced as role models. A kind of American morality we’ve seen for decades adopted by men. I imagine there’s a rich feminist history of this, that I don’t know much about, but it’s a concept I find fascinating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I could’ve formulated a coherent thought about this after the film, I would’ve asked Reichardt and Williams. But I wonder if this is even something they’ve consciously considered. Or if it is the result of working hard, hustling and making successful careers for themselves as film-makers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sarah Paulson is magnetic on screen in this film. She is so good at her job that it feels like she is acting just for you on screen. It’s a remarkable feat of acting, for which she deserves high praise. Mark Duplass, unfortunately, was just out-matched against an actor like her. His character, tasked with a high degree of difficulty scene near the end, was ill-matched against Paulson who accomplished similar goals with aplomb.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The movie, in all, is a simple, Linklater-esque, film about two high school sweethearts who reconnect after decades apart. They pick up where they left off, spend some lovely hours together, and dive back into old memories and old habits to remind themselves of who they once were.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On its face, this type of movie is usually unobjectionable or forgettable. We get a few of them every year. But there was something about this particular story, these particular actors, and the evocation of feeling that really struck a chord with me. I had a relationship like this in high school, a formative experience for me, that now exists as memories laden with emotion. I’ve never had the reconnecting experience the way Jim and Amanda get to experience, but the weight those memories carry weighs heavy even now, more than 10 years later. Watching those experiences get depicted on screen, often in uncannily similar ways to my own experience, took a hold of me and did not let go for the run time of this film. Again, here I must highlight how much Paulson carries this film. There are entire scenes and sequences when the camera is glued to her face and she pulls these scenes off so well. The power of acting is fully on display in her performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps this film resonated for me more than the average viewer because I connected with it so strongly. It left me feeling blue, thinking fondly back on old love, wishing for but also dreading ever reconnecting with my old self or with a new her. In a season marked by public tension and political drama, it was wonderful to shift my focus through a work of personal art like this. I didn’t begrudge for one second the tears flowing down my face when this film finished. I was thankful for the feeling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last year’s &lt;em&gt;Gone Girl&lt;/em&gt; had some redeeming qualities. It had some interesting subsersive gender themes. For people like me who hadn’t read the book, the twist was entertaining. Fincher’s directing and cinematography were enjoyable on the big screen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went into &lt;em&gt;The Girl on the Train&lt;/em&gt; with similar expectations. I figured the characters and plot wouldn’t be impressive, but maybe some other aspects of the movie would draw me in. Unfortunately, I found nothing to draw me in. No interesting ideas, no interesting plot themes, the twist was largely predictable and not that well executed, a Middle Eastern therapist spoke Spanish (for whatever reason), Emily Blunt had chapped lips which I guess were meant to make her seem unappealing but she’s still Emily Blunt so that didn’t quite work either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I’m trying to say, I guess, is that this is not a good movie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seeing &lt;em&gt;Toni Erdmann&lt;/em&gt; in a full theater at the NY Film Festival was one of the best decisions I’ve made this fall. I spend a lot of time in theaters but this cinematic experience was deeply rewarding in the presence of hundreds of other people who were all in stitches, laughing harder scene after scene. The film is hilarious, it makes for the quickest 162 minutes I can remember for a film, and the film-makers and actors deserve the accolades they are receiving world wide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of my favorite themes in this film (and it deals with a lot: sexism, professionalism, globalism, EU relations, among a few) is its exploration of parenting an adult. So much of parenting is about the difficulties of emotional relationships between adults and children. But the majority of parenting happens between adults and grown children (also known as adults). Winfried/Toni’s relationship with Ines is beautifully drawn in this film, with ebbs and flows that feel real and properly earned. The building blocks were certainly on the page when the film makers began, and the acting and directing added depth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A parent/child relationship between two adults is unlike any other relationship adults have. Unending love met with unforgiving angst makes for great dramatic tension. Turn up one of those knobs to 11 and you’ve got yourself one of the year’s best comedies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A documentary with a strong Jim Jarmusch touch to it. Iggy Pop and Jarmusch were both in attendance at the NYFF screening I attended. Iggy, his body broken, his skin leathery, his voice hoarse, is no less spirited today than he was at age 20. Much of the film is centered around stories he tells on camera or off camera. His zeal for life, and his fondness for the time he spent with the stooges is immediately apparent. There is also a wisdom in his words. Although a man of few words as a song-writer, Iggy Pop has a wealth of wisdom and knowledge in story telling through references to art, pop-culture, film, and TV.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jarmusch, similarly, carries with him a sort of wisdom. It’s clear, both from the film and the brief Q and A after, that he found Iggy and the Stooges at a formative stage in life. I would’ve loved to see more of Jarmusch’s personal relationship with the music and the band on screen.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I’ve said this before here, or elsewhere, but Maggie Nelson is one of my favorite writers. I’m becoming convinced, with every book I read, that poets are the only good writers. The rest of us are just trying to imitate them. To take such esoteric and specific topics as avant-garde visual and performative art, and carry a lay reader through a full set of (often complex) arguments, is no easy task. Nelson sometimes succeeds and sometimes fails, but she never loses your attention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Her ability to describe works of art, to situate them in cultural context, to provide criticism and exegesis while simultaneously carrying a set of arguments from beginning to end is a masterful accomplishment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This book did not hit me as much as some of her other work, especially Bluets and the Argonauts. My current guess as to why, is that those books are much more rooted in her personal life. Her self-described “auto-theory” (a combination of autobiography and cultural theory) is what works the most on me. I look forward to more work from her in this vein.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Dealing with a protagonist who is at once obsessed with herself and repulsed by herself is difficult for the average reader. Psychology has much to say about this duality, something many of us deal with in ourselves day after day. So following a character who is as difficult on herself as some of us are on ourselves is not exactly the escape some readers expect from a novel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I, however, am a sucker for this type of thing. Literature, and art on the whole I suppose, if it can be described as having a goal should allow you to live a completely different life for the time that you’re experiencing it. Eileen, in this way, reminded me most of An Unnecessary Woman. Another book set entirely in the head of a woman whose internal monologue was enough to fill the pages of an entire book without losing my attention. However, instead of a young, American woman in the 1960s, that book allowed me to live the life of an older, Lebanese woman.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s somewhat unfortunate that this book was billed as a thriller, with a crime at its center. Even the cover design and jacket blurb highlight this aspect of the book over others. I understand the need to market a book as a thriller, but the best parts of this novel are the writing, the inner life of Eileen, her relationship with two of the main characters, and the descriptions of her relationship to herself. Seeding the reader with the idea that a crime is lurking at any moment can cloud our ability to focus on the first 4/5 of the book which is full of greatness and instead keep our eyes peeled for the last 1/5, which is not nearly as noteworthy.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I can’t remember the last time a how-to book was this fun to read. What started as a course syllabus for a memoir writing class Mary Karr teaches at Syracuse, fleshed out into a fantastic book about writing, self-reflection, memory, narrative and the power of personal story telling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My favorite bits of this book are the parts when Karr picks an author, a book, or a style and uses it explicate an idea. Her talents in writing and teaching are on display in these moments, as she dives deep in Nabokov, or tears apart Frey or Mortenson, or lavishes praise on Michael Herr. It made for the best kind of annotated bibliography for someone like me, who is very interested in this genre.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Karr’s voice makes her sound like someone with whom I’d just love to hang out. But behind her easy writing, jokes, and sage advice is a lifetime’s worth of wisdom about honesty, truth, and telling your life’s story.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://letterboxd.com/samarthbhaskar/film/margaret/&quot;&gt;LetterboxD review link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Margaret&lt;/em&gt;, the shorter, theatrical release was streaming on Netflix a few years ago. I remember watching it then and enjoying it, especially Anna Paquin’s performance, but it wasn’t a particularly memorable film for me. Recently, I saw a screening of the longer cut at the Metrograph with Kenneth Lonegran and J. Smith-Cameron in attendance. Nary a 3-hour film feels this short, and urgent, with such locomotion even though there’s really only one action sequence near the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s an incomplete list of things that make this film a masterpiece:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the beautiful slow motion interludes: &lt;em&gt;Margaret&lt;/em&gt; is peppered with slow moving but grand interludes of music and New York landscapes (buildings and people alike). They add an aesthetic enjoyment to this film that elevates it overall.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ethical dilemmas: all the twists and turns that Lisa&#39;s involvement in Emily and Monica&#39;s lives are frought with ethical and moral questions. Lisa is dealing with them on screen while we the audience deal with them in our seats.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Acting: Paquin&#39;s range, Cameron-Smith&#39;s softness and vulnerability, Mark Ruffalo&#39;s quiet pleading, Jeannie Berlin&#39;s, well, every frame on screen; this film is chock full of amazing performances that always let Paquin stay front and center but embue each character&#39;s behavior with meaning&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The writing and dialog: if I had to pick a single feature of this film that rises above the rest it would be Lonegran&#39;s writing. His depiction of a certain type of New York Upper West Side life is simultaneously realistic and literary. The dialog he gives to his actors, could (with lesser actors) have been too heavy a weight. But none of the performances buckle under the weight of his heavy words, instead their behavior and presence elevate to meet the challenge. Longeran has also created one of the most fascinating young-adult female characters in recent memory with Lisa. Her relationship with her mother, her father, with Emily, with Paul, her brother, her friends, each more fascinating than the next. And in this longer cut, each is given proper treatment, allowing us to learn about and gain from her encounters with them all.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, this film deserves the credit it has received among critics. It deserves to be seen in this longer, more demanding, but also more rewarding cut. And Lonegran deserves to be counted among a list of film-makers who have imagined, written and created masterpieces on screen.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;If memoir, as a genre, succeeds or fails on voice, this memoir has a uniquely successful voice. Reading MacDonald’s writing on falconry, her relationship with her father, her descriptions of nature, her thoughts on writers who came before her, is an immersive experience. I was never in the market for a book on falconry, or a biography of T.H. White, or a book filled with lush, flowing, and at times precise nature writing, or a memoir about bereavement - but this book represents that illusive but prized literary experience, coming across something new you never you wanted, but are glad to have found.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trying to recreate the magic and (yes) magnificence of Kurosawa’s &lt;em&gt;Seven Samurai&lt;/em&gt; is a difficult task. I’ve never seen the 1960 American adaptation, but the premise itself - a Western with cowboys, horses, and shootouts based on a Samurai epic - is interesting enough. Unfortunately, this latest adaptation fell mostly in the category of forgettable remakes. Chris Pratt, charged with the task of bringing levity and heart to the ensemble, following in the footsteps of the inimitable Toshiro Mifune also falls short.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lists of directors with great promise, but a long fall from grace come around every few years. M Night Shyamalan is frequently in that conversation (although I’d say &lt;em&gt;Unbreakable&lt;/em&gt; is his ticket out of those conversations once and forever). It seems Antoine Fuqua belongs on these lists, until he can prove otherwise. After &lt;em&gt;Training Day&lt;/em&gt; he was poised to be a great new voice for this generation of films. Instead, we’ve gotten few original, provocative, or even interesting works from him since.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://letterboxd.com/samarthbhaskar/film/snowden/&quot;&gt;LetterboxD review link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Snowden&lt;/em&gt; is, as everyone’s been saying, Oliver Stone’s least dogmatic film. It is his least provocative, least paranoid, and probably most approachable. To my mind, Stone laid off the paranoia and grandiosity in this film because the truth is supposed to be scary enough. But that’s the ultimate irony of this story: although we should all be terrified of mass surveillance, without consent, we’re all basically mollified by the pleasures the Internet provides. Perhaps not even a loud a voice as Stone’s can shake us up enough to do something drastic about this. And that was Snowden’s ultimate fear, that even knowing all of this, the public would do nothing. That nothing would change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JGL’s performance, though distracting for some, worked for me. For most of the runtime, I was along for the ride, buying wholly into his portrayal of Snowden. Even the voice acting, which I thought would bother me, worked out nicely. In one scene, in the Hong Kong hotel before he bids goodbye to his compatriots, Levitt’s reflection, in a window, is set against the backdrop of Hong Kong’s skyline. It was in that moment that I was taken out of the film, and marveled at how uncanny his likeness was to Snowden.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, the film is less successful than it’s documentary-sibling &lt;em&gt;Citizenfour&lt;/em&gt;. It’s slightly overlong, the plotting and dramatic tension is not as compelling, and there’s little new information or feeling you get from watching it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before I went to see this, a friend said he was turned off seeing this film by the “faux edginess for the Vice generation” that he gathered from the trailer. I’ll admit, this colored my viewing of the film. Although I appreciated how gritty and grimy the whole film felt, really pulling me into the world of these characters, I had a hard time trying to get what this film was trying to get across. Is it about privilege? About Leah’s ability to traverse the world of sex and drugs with impunity in a way that Blue never can? Is it about excess? Is it about youth? Ambition? It seems to be lacking a core philosophy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a complaint I have heard many people make about art made by young people. In our time, we are called millennials, I suppose. Many podcasts, articles, blogs, films, or photography made by millennials that I come across seems to be lacking a fully fledged world view, or politics, or philosophy. Instead, it opts for immersion, an explication of feelings, or just wading about in what it’s like to be the artist or the protagonist. I think this sort of art can and does have power. It is also closely related to post-modernism, the closest “era” we can attach ourselves to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But after a while, swimming around in the horrors and excesses of Leah’s life, I start to feel cruel as a viewer. I feel cruel for barging into the life of this artist, or this character. I don’t need to feel compassion for a piece of art to work. But cruelty for cruelty’s sake, or “faux grit” as my friend put it, can also be a defeated proposition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe I’m also just over-thinking this film in particular. Made by a millennial artist, maybe all it’s supposed to be is a good story or an opportunity for me to live life as someone else for a couple of hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Southside With You&lt;/em&gt; has some of the same DNA as the Linklater &lt;em&gt;Before Sunrise&lt;/em&gt; series. It borrows from some of Spike Lee’s work, even including &lt;em&gt;Do The Right Thing&lt;/em&gt; prominently in the plot. But unlike those film-makers, Richard Tanne lacks a personal style. But that doesn’t drag the movie down too far. The main focus on two fascinating characters, two fascinating public figures of our time, is enough to keep this film buoyant and entertaining throughout.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In getting to know the Obama’s as a national, highly politicized couple, we’ve lost sight of the fact that they’re America’s premiere example of a successful black couple. Both of their futures, as young people, are beautifully on display here. And to a large extent, they’ve delivered on their talents and promise. (Part of me has always wondered what Michelle Obama’s ceiling would’ve been if she hadn’t spent more than a decade working to only further Barack’s career.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have so many examples of young black people, with promise, failing to realize it. Because our country places more ditches in their way than bridges. It’s great to reflect on what it looks like when they do achieve it. And for Obama-die-hards, there are plenty of small details in the film to chew over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;American emigrant or ex-patriate stories are not all too common. Black Americans as emigrants are even less common on screen. Black families without a matriarch and a father-son relationship not characterized by absence or violence are also not often portrayed in film. All of these elements made this an unfamiliar starting point for a story. And yet, I related to Morris so much. He was about the same age as I was when I immigrated to the United States from India. But unlike Morris, I didn’t have the baggage of an identity as a young black boy exported around the world through films, music, sports and other easily accessible American culture and media. It was enough to deal with the complexities of immigration as a pre-teen, dealing with an added layer of race and American cultural hegemony would’ve been a lot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both protagonists, Craig Robinson and Markees Christmas, put in solid acting performances. Craig Robinson, though, almost stole the movie in one prolonged scene in the end that shows him being the kind of father I can only hope to be someday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The movie isn’t perfect, it doesn’t address every issue the story could’ve addressed, but I connected to it because of my own background. I liked seeing this slice of life dramatized, brought to screen for an American audience. And I hope it comes across more people’s radars, so they too can get an idea about the life of a pre-teen emigrant boy trying to find his way in the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ava Duvernay is about to have a big winter. So I thought I’d watch one of her earlier works. Her confidence and perspective as a director is not fully on display here, but the makings of a great director are present. Duvernay’s strongest talent is creating full, beautiful, black characters. There’s a small moment in the film when the protagonist, Ruby, is getting ready for bed. She wraps her hair, growing frustrated and going to sleep without her head scarf. I can’t say for sure, but I imagine for many non-black audiences of this film, this was the first time they had to contend with the thought that black women wrap their hair before going to bed. The inner or personal lives of black women aren’t often portrayed on screen with such intimacy. Or if they are, they’re in service of some other character’s story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Duvernay portrays these small slices of lives we don’t usually see, with ease. Wrapping them into grander stories about the impact of incarceration on black families. Or about the struggle for civil rights. Or whatever other stories compel her in the future. Along the way, I’m thankful that we’ll get to see more of the world through the perspective of full, beautiful, black characters. Especially fully realized black women characters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clint Eastwood is a great director. Perhaps one of America’s best directors. There is no doubt that a man who can take a story like the water landing of US Airwarys Flight 1549 and make an entertaining movie out of it has talent and experienced honed over decades in the industry. In fact, you need look no further than &lt;em&gt;Unforgettable&lt;/em&gt; to truly see how talented Clint Eastwood is. Here in &lt;em&gt;Sully&lt;/em&gt; the telling, and re-telling, of the same few minutes of action is somehow neither repetitive nor boring. The main story is told with verve each time. Eastwood is great at scenes, less so at moments. The major scenes in the plane and in the interrogation rooms largely succeed. The moments with Sully and his wife and flashbacks to his youth succeed much less.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there’s something about this film that bothered me throughout: the role of the “villian” NTSB, unions and government. Films need tension, of course. But something about painting the NTSB, the government and unions as foes for this stoic hero seems ill-fitting. Then I remember that Clint Eastwood, in 2012, talked to an empty chair representing Obama at the Republican National Convention and everything makes sense again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eastwood is also, almost in a sickening way, bent on putting himself at the center of his recent films. His self-conception - a laconic, strong-willed, chisel-jawed, well mannered American man with a measured mustache - describes Eastwood more than it describes the real Sully. (The real Sully went on to fight for pilot’s welfare after attaining national prominence, arguing for better union rights and pay.) Also, going running in Times Square (which no New Yorker or visitor to New York ever does) and seeing &lt;em&gt;Gran Torino&lt;/em&gt; posters plastered everywhere came off a bit thirsty in terms of Eastwood trying to interject himself into the film. I suppose much like the Americans who wish to “Make America Great Again”, Eastwood is having a hard time imagining an America without him at the center.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Colson Whitehead is on a media tear with this book. So reviews, coverage, interviews are aplenty. My favorite piece, pegged on the release of this book, is Kathryn Schulz’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/08/22/the-perilous-lure-of-the-underground-railroad&quot;&gt;essay&lt;/a&gt; in the New Yorker. In it, she describes, through her usual deep historical research and captivating writing, many realities about the Underground Railroad. That it was, in fact, probably not very regularly used. That it does more for myth-making, absolving white guilt, turning attention to individual actors instead of institutions and providing moral comfort for Americans than it ever did for the slaves who putatively used it in the 19th century. It’s a great companion to this book.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whitehead’s book is a good addition to the set of literature about this topic. His writing - probably the best feature of this book - is sharp, emotional, shocking, literary, and requires your undivided attention. This is not a book that washes over you with ease. It is a book that requires you to do work as you read. What James McBride did for the run-away-slave narrative with humor and satire, Whitehead does with imaginative fiction and character building. &lt;em&gt;The Good Lord Bird&lt;/em&gt; was satirical, funny, tongue-in-cheek and &lt;em&gt;Underground Railroad&lt;/em&gt; is serious, literary and emotionally relentless. The balance between plot, character, and environment is finely tuned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The promise of the premise - an actual railroad running underground through states that represent different modes of America dealing with slaves and black Americans - pays off through great writing, full characters and a plot worthy of its premise.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://letterboxd.com/samarthbhaskar/film/kubo-and-the-two-strings/&quot;&gt;LetterboxD review link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is an incomplete list of things that I was thinking about while watching &lt;em&gt;Kubo and the Two Strings&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;children dealing with parents with mental health issues&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;children dealing with grandparents with memory loss, alzheimer’s or other neurological or degenerative diseases&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;generational conflict. Namely, the kind of thing that is happening around the world lately, politically. Where older generations are trying to hang on to the world they knew, while younger generations are fighting for power to change the world into something new.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the power of stories and narrative in our lives. How stories help us make sense of life, which can otherwise just be a stream of events with no clear starts, middles or ends.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a couple of quotes, which I seem to have mixed up in my memory, but which go something like “we are the stories we tell ourselves, so we must be careful what stories we tell ourselves”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, &lt;em&gt;Kubo and the Two Strings&lt;/em&gt; is chock full of these themes and plot ideas. These ideas are carried in a deceptively traditional journey-centric fable, which can at times feel less ambitious than the ideas it is trying to convey. But combined with beautiful, sharp animation, this becomes a memorable film experience.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Grizzly Man</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://letterboxd.com/samarthbhaskar/film/grizzly-man/&quot;&gt;LetterboxD review link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Grizzy Man&lt;/em&gt; is often listed among the best documentaries of all time. It absolutely deserves this accolade, in my opinion. The footage found (sent? bequeathed to?) by Werner Herzog and the subsequent journey he goes on to tell Treadwell’s story came together to create a cinematic experience for the ages. That this footage fell into Herzog’s hands is a small miracle. That he took this footage and created this piece of art is a testament to his artistry. Herzog has us in the palm of his hands the whole time, he is at his editing and directing peak here. You can read more about the technical and story telling achievements in other reviews of the film, I’m sure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To me, though, an important and under-discussed aspect of the movie is Treadwell’s personality. Namely, the actor that blossomed inside of him. There’s a personality trait - we all know people like this - that is specific to actors. They crave attention. They turn “on” in front of people, or even more so in front of cameras. They seem to filter their behavior through some sort of lens when they know they’re being observed. Treadwell, it seems, displayed this personality type to a great extent. It is this personality type that probably caused him to capture 10s or 100s of hours of himself in the wilderness. Other wilderness stories, particularly in the American myth making machine, are about solitude and character building. Treadwell pinned his aspirations to this myth but he clearly had not solitude or character in mind but fame and feeling special. I felt, and feel, uneasy about this aspect of the film. About Treadwell achieving in death, that which he set out to accomplish in life, basically on his own terms, but at the cost of another person’s life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Herzog is nihilistic, yes, but I think he truly wishes he wasn’t. He wouldn’t have made 4 decades worth of films if he truly thought life meant nothing. He is like a cancer patient, hell bent on finding a cure for himself. He’s perpetually in the laboratory, hard at work.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Hillbilly Elegy - A Memoir of a Family and Culture in Crisis</title>

   <id>/books/hillbilly-elegy-a-memoir-of-a-family-and-culture-in-crisis</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I paired this book with &lt;em&gt;White Trash&lt;/em&gt;, Nancy Issenberg’s more academic historical look at the white underclass in America since founding. What Issenberg was missing in characters, tone, emotion and personality, Vance picks up in this book. And what Vance is missing in history, context, data and evidence, is largely available in Issenberg’s book. They make for a good pairing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, my only real complaint with &lt;em&gt;Hillbilly Elegy&lt;/em&gt; is the quality of the writing. Vance is a lawyer and it shows. His writing, instead of being literary or ebullient, is more straight forward and structured. There’s nothing wrong with that type of writing but usually memoirs, especially those with strong emotional underpinnings are wont to try, through writing style, convey emotionality. I got a good sense of Vance’s relationship with his mother, his grandparents, his sister and his wife but I would’ve loved for those emotions to come through the writing more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beyond the writing and emotionality, I found Vance’s picture of white America well painted, his arguments well thought and his world view well conveyed. His solutions, surprisingly, were more institution centric than I would’ve expected. Yes, he asks his family and friends in his home town to reconsider their work ethic and take personal responsibility for their decline. But many of the things he outlines as reasons for his success are traditional institutions like church, family, work, the military, higher education and some government programs like the GI Bill (although he’s critical of other government programs like child foster care). The importance of personal responsibility was a welcomed addition to this conversation, for me, because liberal corners of this literature tend to diminish its importance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vance, more than Issenberg, is more successful at dealing with the question of race in his book. He builds a better case for understanding why poor whites are reluctant to understand or believe major narratives about race relations because they see their own decline and their own plight as similar to that of black Americans. Poor whites feel like outsiders in American society just as much as black Americans, at times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sausage Party&lt;/em&gt; is a &lt;em&gt;Team America: World Police&lt;/em&gt;-esque, pun-filled, adult humor riddled, comedy that doubles as a atheist polemic parable for modern day man-children. That makes it sound like a pretty specific movie but, somehow, it sort of works. I didn’t find it as smart (maybe wise-ass is a better word) as Trey Parker and Matt Stone’s work in &lt;em&gt;South Park: Bigger, Longer, Uncut&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Team America: World Police&lt;/em&gt;. Their work tends to have a more fully formed world view and a stronger politics at its center. &lt;em&gt;Sausage Party&lt;/em&gt;’s sense of polemics felt slightly shoe-horned. The film-makers’ first and foremost goal, it is clear, was puns, toilet jokes, dick jokes and the like. And they’re pretty good at that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was pretty disengaged the whole time. The story felt a bit “lol nothing matters.” The acting was fine. For some reason, the action sequences and even some of the regular shots were very dark, making it hard to follow what was happening on screen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did chuckle at the futuristic metro stations. Which look exactly like the Dubai metro stations first built in like 2009-2010.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;White Trash&lt;/em&gt; is a highly readable work of social history. It delves into the worlds of history, politics, sociology, economics, and media studies with an eye toward class in America. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’ve found myself in many discussions lately about the rise of populism in America, the continuing racism at the center of our politics and policies, the popularity of national candidates like Trump and Sanders, and the failures of democratic institutions to serve all citizens equitably. Invariably, during these discussions, the role of race and class is brought up. Isenberg, in this book, sets out with a singular focus - to tell the story of class in America, since its inception. This is a welcomed addition to other narratives about racism, economic inequality, the urban/rural split and so on. Although Isenberg’s addition is largely well constructed, she chooses - seemingly arbitrarily - to dive deep into certain episodes of American history while ignoring others. No one book can encompass the entirety of this argument, yes, and she is clear at the beginning what she is and is not going to discuss, but some explanation of why there is so little discussion of race, why the singular focus on Whites, why the lack of discussion of WWII for example, would’ve helped to bolster her case. At one point she describes a separation between race and class but spends very little time drawing out that argument. I would’ve loved more discussion about where racism loses explanatory power and where classism picks up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end, this book provides great context to understand America as it exists today. To understand the plight of white Americans in rural areas like the South and Appalachia. To give a fuller picture of power dynamics in our country that depend on exploitation, hoarding of power in certain circles, while systematically keeping it from others. Recent socio-economic patterns, like those described by Case and Deaton in their study of drug abuse and mortality rates among poor whites, are only the latest canaries in century old coal mines. It is upon us to keep digging.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I think this is primarily a factor of my lack of familiarity with the genre or my inability to find good fantasy books to capture my attention, but there have been very few fantasy or even pseudo fantasy stories that have moved me emotionally. Unfortunately, this is true for most of the stories in Kelly Link’s &lt;em&gt;Get in Trouble&lt;/em&gt;. I had a hard time getting emotionally invested in many of the characters, and the parts that worked for me were largely those that stuck to realism. That may be too harsh, there were definitely some non-realist elements that worked for me. But it was always when they were in service of the emotional journey of the protagonist or to highlight a plot or character detail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My favorite stories, for what its worth, were “Secret Identity,” “The New Boyfriend,” and “The Summer People”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People have written about, talked about and discussed this film for 60 years. I’m hardly the man to add something brand new to the conversation. The whole I was watching this film, recently, though, the main thing on my mind were the silences and pauses in editing. Each shot, reaction, counter-balance and juxtaposition frame in this film is set up with plenty of space at both the beginning and end. This creates a meditative feel to the whole film. Not only is this editing present in contemplative, emotional moments (where we might expect it in other films), it is also present in the comedy and action scenes (where traditionally, film makers opt for less time and space).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is one among many seemingly simple choices that Kurosawa makes that bring out the complexity of this film. Other choices include his frame selection, the placement of faces and characters to convey depth of field, blocking and photography, the acting (especially Toshiro Mifune) and the overall tone management from section to section.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The screening I attended, a 4-hour 35MM showing at the Metrograph in NYC, was introduced by Helen Dewitt, author of The Last Samurai (no relation to the film). In it, she emphasized Kurosawa’s interest in and questioning of traditional class and caste status in Japan. He spends much of the film probing the idea of who gets to be samurai or peasant and why. Kurosawa was, clearly, ahead of his time as a film-maker but also as a student of identity politics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vittorio Storaro’s photography in &lt;em&gt;Café Society&lt;/em&gt; is possibly the best cinematography in a Woody Allen film since Gordon Willis’ in &lt;em&gt;Manhattan&lt;/em&gt;. That might sound hyperbolic but you’ve got to see the photography in this film. It is worth the price of admission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other benefits of seeing this film include: Kristen Stewart, who seems to have taken her experience in &lt;em&gt;Clouds of Sils Maria&lt;/em&gt; and is totally running with it. And I for one am happy to see her turn in one fantastic performance after another. Some interesting philosophical stuff about Judaism, Christianity, end-of-life thoughts. And, well, that’s about all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, the film is ok. It is not among Allen’s best. But it is not his worst.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mike Birbiglia has always struck me as a warm, soulful, comedian. But rarely is he wise or sagacious. His stand-up, his segments on This American Life, his film and TV work are always funny but rarely do they stay with me over time. He’s mostly unobjectionable. His art, to me it seems, is mostly without politics. Without a target.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As such, &lt;em&gt;Don’t Think Twice&lt;/em&gt; was a mostly unobjectionable, enjoyable, sometimes sentimental film. As a piece of art that espouses a variety of emotions, it was only middlingly successful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, as homage to improv, a much-beloved and increasingly important part of the American comedy universe, it was much more successful. Birbiglia captures, with great acuity and narrative ease, the life of improv comedians, the mechanics of the art form and why he, and his compatriots, think so highly of it. This film could be for improv what &lt;em&gt;Comedian&lt;/em&gt;, the 2002 documentary featuring Jerry Seinfeld, is for stand up.&lt;/p&gt;

The awards it received, critical and popular praise throughout last year, all made me want to find something to enjoy. But I just couldn’t make it through. It took me much longer than I care to admit to make my way through. And I think I more or less came down to the quality of the writing as the biggest reason why I couldn’t like this book. There wasn’t enough artistry in Nguyen’s writing to balance out the over-wrought, heavy, plotting. The lack of literary quality left me feeling feckless and uninterested as a reader.&lt;/p&gt;

After a while, you begin to think that it is you who had these original, lyrical, thoughts. It is you who feels the world so deeply. It is you who loves color, sex, pain, intellect and all the other things Nelson loves. But it is never really you, of course. It is always Maggie Nelson’s writing. I feel smarter while reading her, and better for having done it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you can help it, try going in to &lt;em&gt;Tickled&lt;/em&gt; with two things: (1) only view the trailer and (2) view, read, listen to nothing else about it. Knowing very little about this film really pays off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some parts, especially the middle third, that drag. Some elements, like the slow-motion, music-laden, &lt;em&gt;Jiro Dreams of Sushi&lt;/em&gt;-esque montages, feel derivative, but they sort of work in bringing some diversity to the tone of the film. And overall, you’re not going to find much adventure in the film-making. But the subject and the story alone take this film a long way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Netflix is on a laser-focused, single-minded mission. They want to create as much content as possible that will appeal to as wide a subscriber base as possible. They want to invest in original content, heavily, to decrease their licensing costs. They want to use data to create profiles of films, actors, genres, topics that will give viewers a mix of things they know they’ll like. My first glimpse of this was a few years ago when the first season of Orange is the New Black premiered. In it, they had a small part for an Ira Glass type character. In the instant that that character showed up, I felt watched, I felt seen (but not in a good way). I realized immediately that they knew I - a subscriber, young, urban, educated, male - would point at the TV and say “hey, look, it’s kind of like Ira Glass!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Fundamentals of Caring&lt;/em&gt; is another of Netflix’s formulaic original features. Whether its episodic TV shoes, or feature films, Netflix is combing its trove of archival content and creating new original content that will soon replace it. Like &lt;em&gt;Garden State&lt;/em&gt;? Or &lt;em&gt;Short Term 12&lt;/em&gt;? Or &lt;em&gt;What’s Eating Gilbert Grape&lt;/em&gt;? This movie might not be as good, but it’s heartfelt and witty, like those others. And it has Paul Rudd! You like Paul Rudd, don’t you? And oh yeah, Netflix already paid for it. So it’s all profit after a while.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a fantastic way to build a business. But it’s not such a great way to build art, unfortunately. The whole time I was watching this movie, I was thinking, this is unobjectionable. It is saccharine. And now I think that’s exactly what Netflix wanted me to think. Come get your sugar water.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Black Lives Matter Reading List</title>

   <updated>2016-07-19T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/black_lives_matter_reading_list</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Lately, I’ve been participating in discussions (online and in person) about Black Lives Matter, police brutality, protests, and race relations. In one of these discussions, a friend brought up the frustration she feels when talking about these topics with friends and family who are less than sympathetic to the argument put forth by the Black Lives Matter movement. In her own words:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I feel surrounded by people who, I feel, do not fully understand the challenges black people face, and have faced for so long. They don’t get the implications of slavery, because well, “that was centuries ago and they should be over it by now. Black people enslaved other blacks in Africa. blah blah” Ugh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;But what it often boils down to is the sentiment that black people should just miraculously pull themselves out of poverty, unemployment, a broken family structure, poor education, a terrible criminal justice system, and go get a job. Because they, “we”, were immigrants and struggled, so why shouldn’t black people have to struggle too? Why give them “handouts?” “Why are the police to blame when they kill each other more often, and kill police as well?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I understand where these arguments come from, but I wish I could articulate and try to paint a picture of many of their lives and history so they can start possibly seeing things in a different light. Anyways, this is probably more of a phone conversation, but it’s just been on my mind as it’s always a sore topic in my house. And I’m not doing my due diligence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this in mind, I noted down this list of writers, books, articles, movies and music that came to mind. They have helped me understand race relations in the United States since I was in high school. I look to these and similar works to continue my education in how my country works. This is not a list of quick arguments, easy definitions, or flashy statistics. It represents an on-going education.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any such list is invariably missing something. Please recommend additions and I’ll update this post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Writers:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ta-nehisi Coates - probably the writer I look to most often for guidance on these issues. Start with the essays listed &lt;a href=&quot;https://longform.org/archive/writers/ta-nehisi-coates&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, especially The Case for Reparations, Letter To My Son (which is an extended excerpt from his book Between The World And Me), and The Black Family in the Age of Mass Incarceration.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;James Baldwin - the intellectual predecessor to Coates. Wrote mostly in the 50s-70s. His speeches and lectures, many on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnIjXmfTSYg&quot;&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt; (like his debate with William F Buckley), are sometimes even better than his written work.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Toni Morrison - a prolific writer, still writing. Song of Solomon, Sula, Beloved, The Bluest Eye are all great works of fiction. Her essays are great too. This &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/12/magazine/the-radical-vision-of-toni-morrison.html&quot;&gt;profile&lt;/a&gt; is also great.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.timwise.org/f-a-q-s/&quot;&gt;Tim Wise&lt;/a&gt; - easily digestible, often logically sound, but less academic. A good starting point, not least because he’s a white guy.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Jelani Cobb - academic and magazine writer. His long piece in the New Yorker this March on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/03/14/where-is-black-lives-matter-headed&quot;&gt;BLM&lt;/a&gt; is a good start.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Cornel West - he’s recently kind of gone off the deep end, but generally his writing is incisive, sharp and part of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/27/books/books-of-the-times-rage-and-reason-in-the-crisis-of-black-america.html&quot;&gt;canon&lt;/a&gt; of great contemporary writing on race relations. A profile &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2009/11/02/the-oracle-3&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Wesley Morris - sports, culture, film writer. But his essays are often full of commentary on more than just sports or art. Like this &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/17/arts/defining-and-proclaiming-a-new-black-power.html&quot;&gt;essay&lt;/a&gt; from a few weeks ago that’s chock full of insights about changes in black culture and new black voices.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;bell hooks - academic, cultural critic, author. Mostly engagaged with feminism theory, post-modernism, capitalism, but race shows up in her work everywhere. Especially &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/385655.Yearning&quot;&gt;Yearning&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Books:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Warmth of Other Sons, Isabel Wilkerson - Possibly the fullest and most complete chronicle of the great migration, setting the table for how blacks left the south, migrated and settled in the north, and built lives in the face of myriad struggles. The legacy of this 6-decade long migration is still present today in cities like Detroit, Chicago, Newark, etc. Review &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/05/books/review/Oshinsky-t.html?pagewanted=all&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Half Has Never Been Told, Edward E. Baptiste - the story of how important slavery was to the founding of this country, and why it still matters. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/05/books/review/the-half-has-never-been-told-by-edward-e-baptist.html&quot;&gt;Review&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Negroland, Margo Jefferson - personal memoir of a journalist, raised on the South Side in the 60s. Relevant as a middle-class counter point to narratives that tend to be about poverty. Which is to say, yes, poverty is a part of the problem, but even middle class blacks live different lives from middle class whites. I wrote about it &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1398305533?book_show_action=false&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Between the World and Me, Tanehisi Coates (as mentioned above). I wrote about it &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1341653747?book_show_action=false&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Fire Next Time, James Baldwin (the intellectual inspiration for Between The World and Me) Short. Fiery. Review &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nybooks.com/articles/1963/02/01/james-baldwin-and-the-man/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Actually, better review &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/books/98/03/29/specials/baldwin-fire.html&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Rap on Race, James Baldwin &amp;amp; Margaret Mead - a conversation in 1970, at the end of the Civil Rights movement, Baldwin and Margaret Mead had a 7+ hour conversation about America, race, basically everything. It is full of wisdom. An essay series on it &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.brainpickings.org/2015/03/19/a-rap-on-race-margaret-mead-and-james-baldwin/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2004/09/12/books/review/arc-of-justice-i-swear-it-was-in-selfdefense.html?_r=0&quot;&gt;Arc of Justice&lt;/a&gt;, Kevin Boyle - about some of the underpinnings of the criminalization of Blacks. That’s a huge issue, and perhaps the most important one, which as I look back over this list, is sorely under-represented. But the relationship between blacks, the justice system, policing and voting is especially important in contemporary discussions.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The New Jim Crow, Michelle Alexander - probably the best, most persuasive argument, in favor of seeing our current prison system as a system of mass incarceration, replacing Jim Crow and slavery before it. It comes up in basically every piece of writing I see now about #BlackLivesMatter, as well it should. Wiki page &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_Jim_Crow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Racecraft, Karen and Barbara Fields - an academic and popular work outlining how “race” was invented to serve “racism” not the other way around. Review &lt;a href=&quot;https://lareviewofbooks.org/article/coloring-outside-the-lines/#!&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Articles:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Racism, Birth Control and Reproductive Rights, Angela Davis (&lt;a href=&quot;http://artecontraviolenciadegenero.org/?wpfb_dl=3&quot;&gt;PDF&lt;/a&gt;) - another scholar and activist from the 70s who had a major impact on black thought. This article in particular is about how black women have been systematically denied birth control and some of the concerns of the feminist movements of the 20th century, like unwanted births or having to raise children out of wedlock against her will, are still disproportionately affecting black women.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.angryasianman.com/2016/07/an-open-letter-to-our-asian-american.html&quot;&gt;Asian American children’s letter to parents in support of BLM&lt;/a&gt; - although targeted toward immigrant parents, there are chunks of this letter that properly grasp the relations between blacks and other minority groups. There’s a lot to be said about the aspirations of minority groups to white privilege and how this co-opts otherwise sympathetic people into anti-black narratives.&lt;/li&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://letterboxd.com/samarthbhaskar/film/the-invitation-2015/&quot;&gt;LetterboxD review link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Invitation&lt;/em&gt; is tense, scary, a fine example of what a better-than-average film in the genre can do. But overall, it is derivative. It adds nothing new or interesting to the genre.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Often films like this, when they’re not moving the genre forward, can bring in something else. Above average acting, cinematography, directing, or something else, perhaps. But even all those elements were mostly average in this case. For example, there’s a framing shot that features Will, the protagonist, in the right-most or left-most third of the screen. The rest of the shot is occupied by a doorway and a long hallway. The first or second time this shot is used, it is interesting. But by the third time it becomes stale. Another shot, with more motion, shows feet - some bare, some in shoes - running up stairs as the camera moves slowly with them in profile. This was a nice way to mix up the pace and framing of the second act. More shots like this, mixed with more traditional, narrative diversity would have made the first two acts feel less bogged down by the structures of the genre.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, I found the film entertaining. But there is hardly any reason to go back and see it for a second time. You get everything there is to get in a single viewing.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Swiss Army Man</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://letterboxd.com/samarthbhaskar/film/swiss-army-man/&quot;&gt;LetterboxD review link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Swiss Army Man&lt;/em&gt; deserves accolades for its fresh premise and a novel idea upon which the filmmakers set out to create a story. The focus on on the corporeal, the exploration of Hank’s id as a brought-back-to-life corpse, the relationship between our physical selves and our self-aware cognition; these are all fertile areas of exploration. Combined with the Michel Gondry or Spike Jones’-esque film-making, the montages set to indie acappella music, solid acting on the part of both the protagonists, this movie should’ve landed more solidly than it did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, the third act doesn’t congeal, there’s no real take home message about the core thesis (the relationship between bodily and non-bodily life) and what started as lean-forward-in-your-seat premise ends up a lean-back-and-throw-your-hands-up ending.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paul Dano, although good in this movie, has already done some of this manic pixie dream girl/guy stuff in &lt;em&gt;Ruby Sparks&lt;/em&gt;. In fact, I was very interested in the exploration of the undertones of homosexuality in this film, but even that avenue never really paid off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of themes, shots, and edits in this film that are used again in &lt;em&gt;No Country for Old Men&lt;/em&gt;. The two films should be considered of an ilk.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://letterboxd.com/samarthbhaskar/film/bill-cunningham-new-york/&quot;&gt;LetterboxD review link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most interesting scenes in &lt;em&gt;Bill Cunningham New York&lt;/em&gt; comes near the end. The film-makers, never shying away from difficult questions, ask Bill about his love life. Has he had partners? Is he gay? Has he ever been in love? Bill deflects the questions away, his modesty fully on display. “Where I grew up, you never talk about such things,” he says. But in the middle of this scene, he also breaks down and cries to himself. The crying happens mid-sentence about his relationship with religion and god. But one can’t help but wonder, if he’s instead mourning a life lived without a loving companion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is well known that Bill was a formidable presence in the world of fashion, at the New York Times and in New York. His recent passing was one of the few times I felt a shroud of sadness around the company, the other was when David Carr passed away last year. Perhaps Bill never had a lover, never felt companionship in the way many of us experience or aspire to, but it can be said without question that he was loved by an industry, a company, a whole city.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Up&lt;/em&gt; + &lt;em&gt;Top of the Lake&lt;/em&gt; + &lt;em&gt;Moonrise Kingdom&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taika Waititi is a confident film maker. His worldview, one characterized by humor, pain, naïveté and openness, is present in this film, just as it was in his earlier film &lt;em&gt;Boy&lt;/em&gt;. It might be a bit harder to find in &lt;em&gt;What We Do In The Shadows&lt;/em&gt; but I would argue it’s there too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hunt for the Wilderpeople&lt;/em&gt; is a fantasy film, or perhaps a film in which each character gets to live their own fantasy but it stays true to its realism. The world we get feels like our own, well not mine exactly, but a version of my world in the New Zealand outback. In this world, Ricky gets to live out his gangster fantasy. Heck gets to live out his roughing it in the bush fantasy. Paula gets to be a bounty hunter, or as Waititi put it in a QandA after the movie, Tommy Lee Jones from &lt;em&gt;The Fugitive&lt;/em&gt;. All these parts fit together nicely for a story with equal parts humor, empathy and openness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t know if I’ll ever turn to Waititi for a hyper-intellectual or overly aesthetic world view. But he and his collaborators continue to turn out lovely work. Work that is “nice” but not in the feckless version of that word.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The opening credits for &lt;em&gt;The Neon Demon&lt;/em&gt; feature Nicolas Winding Refn’s initials in every frame. Why? I couldn’t tell you. But I think it has something to do with narcissism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some laudable things in this movie. The score. The style. The color theory. Some of the acting, mostly Elle Fanning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, overall, there just isn’t enough substance and insight to make this more than an aesthetic experience. If Winding Refn set out to do some moralizing about beauty, narcissism, and fashion, I fear he may be the wrong person for the task.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This was my first time reading a novel by Julian Barnes. It took me some time to become comfortable with the stodgy, overly British nature of his writing, his characters and his plotting. But the adjustment came quickly and this short novel flew by. In terms of platitudes, I’d say the early parts of the novel were better than later parts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To me, the protagonist of this novel suffers in part because he has let no one in. If only he had tried to work through his thoughts and feelings earlier in this life with his lovers, wife, friends, anyone, he might have avoided this fate later in life. But now, after years of being this way, he has little choice left to change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Therein lies the irony: a predilection for self-preservation and risk avoidance is usually best served by taking risks and opening yourself up to others. It seems counter-intuitive but it’s the only thing I’ve ever found that works.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The word “necessary” is brutal. We all know what happens to unnecessary things, they are ended. Are translations necessary? Are critics necessary? If we argue that art is necessary for a full life, isn’t that need filled when a work of art is created? Are the derivatives of art, like criticism and translation, necessary? (I’ll stop with the annoying rhetorical questions now)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In naming this book “An Unnecessary Woman”, Rabih Alameddine gives the reader a provocation. Thankfully, throughout this book, he does the reader a service by engaging with that provocation and illuminating a thoughtful answer. Yes, translation and criticism are a necessary part of art and life. Aaliya, the protagonist and singular voice of this book, is funny, warm, sharp, wise, acerbic, well-read, well-spoken and alone. Rabih, through Aaliya, builds a fluid novel void of traditional structure and plotting that shows the importance of literature, critical thinking, intellectual engagement, independent thought and building a good life for yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The novel ends with some calls to emotion which worked for me. However, I enjoyed much more the first 7/8 of this book. It felt like a safari through the mind of a character I had never known but immediately loved and trusted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In an interview around the time of publication, Alameddine said something to the effect of “the problem, right now, is that we define who is necessary by society’s standards. A lawyer is more necessary than a garbage collector. A doctor more necessary than a bartender. But the truth is, what makes something necessary is how much commitment one has to the life they are living.” I find this a beautiful, and (forgive me) necessary, sentiment for our times.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://letterboxd.com/samarthbhaskar/film/weiner/&quot;&gt;LetterboxD review link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although Anthony Weiner is the central figure in &lt;em&gt;Weiner&lt;/em&gt;, I found myself focusing more on his wife Huma Abiden and the city of New York. This is in part because I just couldn’t take Weiner seriously. He is a man lacking discipline and will power. He displays all the stereotypical characteristics we’ve come to learn identify politicians - megalomania, self-involvement, an over grown need for attention. But he also lacks some of the other qualities that can bring balance - leadership, intelligence, vision and empathy. He is funny, though, which helps rescue the film a bit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Huma Abiden, on the other hand, is an interesting focal point. Though she speaks sparingly, shots of her face tell many stories. She is a woman caught between decisions. She seems to be constantly doing mental calculus about her husband, her career, her family, her place in the public sphere. Huma, throughout this film, seems unsatisfied and unable to find a path to satisfaction. To me, she is a woman seeking advice but unable to make a decision for herself about what she wants. She does say she has forgiven Weiner and will stick by his side but it’s a decision she doesn’t sell very well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other exciting part of this documentary was the depiction of NYC. All the peripheral characters, people yelling on the street, people pointing and smirking on sidewalks, members of community meetings captured New York brilliantly. The documentary smartly followed Weiner around all parts of the city and as a result the audience got a 2 hour tour through all the madness, diversity and lovability that comprises New York.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Maggie’s Plan&lt;/em&gt; should be shown at the beginning of grad school as a story about how not to be an academic. The main academic characters in the film are insufferable. They are self-involved, unable to see or learn from the people around them and wholly convinced that their genius is worth other people’s hard work to take care of them. Please don’t be a person or an academic like this, no matter how much of a genius you are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a film, &lt;em&gt;Maggie’s Plan&lt;/em&gt; is mostly funny, at times warm but largely confused, meandering and unsure of itself. Rebecca Miller may have struck gold, though, by portraying Greta Gerwig as a midwesterner. Her affect and temperament is perfectly midwestern and now I’m going to have a hard time imagining any of her characters as anything but.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My introduction to Taika Waititi was through &lt;em&gt;What We Do In The Shadows&lt;/em&gt;, which I loved. In preparation for his upcoming &lt;em&gt;Hunt for the Wilderpeople&lt;/em&gt;, I sought out &lt;em&gt;Boy&lt;/em&gt; and happily it was streaming on Netflix. As the Coen brothers once said directing is all about tone management. Waititi knows the tone he strives for and achieves it time and again. The tone of &lt;em&gt;Boy&lt;/em&gt; matches very well the tone of &lt;em&gt;What We Do In The Shadows&lt;/em&gt;, and both have me looking forward to his future work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Watching this film, I was reminded of &lt;em&gt;The Descendents&lt;/em&gt;. A similar tropical theme and a story about a father’s relationship to his children and the absence of a mother led me to some comparisons. &lt;em&gt;Boy&lt;/em&gt;, better than &lt;em&gt;The Descendents&lt;/em&gt;, conveyed the emotions of children dealing with having to take care of a parent while another parent is entirely missing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I caught up with this Ozu classic at a revival screening this week. The story can largely be summed up in a sentence. But one doesn’t go into a film like this for a heavily plotted story. The pleasures of this film are almost entirely in the directing and editing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The directing and camera work features one beautiful frame after another. The blocking and composition of each scene was enough to capture my attention on their own. Sometimes the dialog and action took me away from admiring how beautiful each shot was (which is admittedly a strange thing to feel while watching a movie). The film was almost entirely shot indoors but the 3 or 4 outdoor scenes were beautiful too. The colors that poured into the frame stood in stark contrast to the muted colors indoors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The editing was also something to marvel. Very few scenes featuring dialog showed both characters on screen at the same time. Instead, the viewers were given the lay of the scene at the onset and then expected to follow the conversation through cuts and edits. The editing also established and maintained a slow, deliberate pace. Each sentence was book-ended with empty space. Each scene was book ended with space. Like the directing, I could’ve spent every scene thinking solely about editing choices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have yet to mention anything about the plot or characters. These parts of the film weren’t nearly as ambitious or successful as the directing and editing but they weren’t neglected either. The story was simple, the protagonists went through change, and there was emotional weight to their journey. Just enough to keep my attention as an audience member. But if I had it my way, I might just watch this movie a few times with no sound. Just for those beautiful frames.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>The Fits</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://letterboxd.com/samarthbhaskar/film/the-fits/&quot;&gt;LetterboxD review link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Black women, especially in film, do a lot of emotional work. They are either old, wise, compassionate, stern and respected or young and hyper-sexual. Black girls, the rare times when they are the focal point of a story, are rarely given the kind of complete characterization that Toni, the protagonist of &lt;em&gt;The Fits&lt;/em&gt; is given. Writer, director and producer Anna Rose Holmer has created a beautiful story about the end of adolescence, the resilience of minority communities (I wonder if she had the Flint lead water disaster in mind while making the film), gender and family. There is so much to love about this film and so much to be excited for future work from a vibrant new voice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Fits&lt;/em&gt; is as much “about” the end of adolescence with the arrival of menstruation or impending adulthood as &lt;em&gt;It Follows&lt;/em&gt; is about scaring teenagers away from sex. Though, the two films have a lot in common. An off-screen monster as a central character. Both use the tools of horror and thriller to great effect, &lt;em&gt;It Follows&lt;/em&gt; more directly than &lt;em&gt;The Fits&lt;/em&gt;. Both are centered in the midwest, although &lt;em&gt;The Fits&lt;/em&gt; is more bullish on the role of community in a city like Cincinnati while &lt;em&gt;It Follows&lt;/em&gt; depicted suburban Detroit as a city largely devoid of community. The biggest departure, though, is the single location conceit and the depth of emotion afforded to the central characters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much like &lt;em&gt;It Follows&lt;/em&gt; was one of my favorite independent films of 2015, &lt;em&gt;The Fits&lt;/em&gt; is one of my favorites of 2016.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russell Crowe and Ryan Gosling make this a better movie than it is. Shane Black’s origin as a writer, or perhaps the mixing of writing and directing, creates a convoluted, unclear feeling throughout the film. Although the neo-noir genre requires some suspension of disbelief, there isn’t enough other stuff to bring this movie together. As a viewer, I was mostly left lost and unsure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I liked &lt;em&gt;Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang&lt;/em&gt; when it came out, and that too benefited from Robert Downey Jr.’s charisma. But unfortunately charisma wasn’t enough to bring this movie over the edge.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In an interview a few years ago, DeLillo mentioned that the first sentence of this book came to him and spoke so loudly that he began working on a book about it. “Everyone wants to own the end of the world…” It’s a powerful sentence. And death is a powerful thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it is also a black-hole of a thing. Nothing can be found once death is at the center. DeLillo, in his twilight years, is clearly thinking a lot about death. I am just entering the prime of my life, so this book just didn’t connect with me. There were times when DeLillo turned his gaze away from death and those sections captured my attention more. Maybe if I return to it when I’m his age, it will speak to me more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This may be sacrilegious, but instead of reading this book, just watch this great Key &amp;amp; Peele sketch featuring an old Stan Lee trying to contend with being old: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9Uh_RucKz8&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://letterboxd.com/samarthbhaskar/film/weekend-2011/&quot;&gt;LetterboxD review link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Andrew Haigh’s &lt;em&gt;45 Years&lt;/em&gt; was one of my favorite 2015 films. When I saw &lt;em&gt;Weekend&lt;/em&gt; was recently inducted into the Criterion collection and it was streaming online, I was more than happy to catch up with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a couple of shots in the film that frame the central couple and the main apartment building where a few of their major scenes occur that stuck with me much past the runtime. 3 of these shots are similar and they reoccur in the 3 major acts of the film. They feature Glen walking on a sidewalk, leaving Russell’s apartment after an encounter together. Another shot, in the 3rd act, frames the couple in a sole lit window in the apartment building, late at night after something of a lovely bender.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each shot, in addition to sequences earlier in the film (the kind that also made &lt;em&gt;45 Years&lt;/em&gt; memorable) that establish Russell’s character walking across a long span from one side of the screen to the other, are some of the best parts of Haigh’s direction. They remind us, the audience, of our gaze. They re-establish a distance that has slowly been bending against the weight of the intimacy we’re let in on. And each time we remember that we know only a little bit about these characters, no matter how much we think we’re privy to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the case of the central relationship in this film, Haigh has done a marvelous job letting us in slowly, over the course of the film, into the bond between Russell and Glen. Their intimacy, sex, passion, love all blossom at a natural pace, even if the premise of it all happening in a weekend might sound trite. Haigh, with lots of help from his lead actors, pulls it all off beautifully. I’m on board for more of this kind of work from Haigh in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biggest irony for this film is that it is trying to critique mass entertainment, doctored suspense and fake alarmism using the tools of the trade. Unfortunately, instead of trying a satirical approach, it tries a self-serious approach. And ultimately that just doesn’t work, despite Jodie Foster’s best attempts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The saddest thing about that is that we absolutely need art to put a mirror up against society in a time like this. Especially about this topic. But I fear this will be a forgotten thriller, aspiring to be like &lt;em&gt;Network&lt;/em&gt; but landing more like &lt;em&gt;Inside Man&lt;/em&gt; + &lt;em&gt;An Inconvenient Truth&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://letterboxd.com/samarthbhaskar/film/love-friendship/&quot;&gt;LetterboxD review link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a few moments at the beginning of &lt;em&gt;Love &amp;amp; Friendship&lt;/em&gt; when title cards float across the screen in quick succession, introducing characters with pithy descriptions. I wondered for a second, am I supposed to know who these people are or why they matter? Is this like when I saw &lt;em&gt;Captain America: Civil War&lt;/em&gt; and missed some of the first act references because it had been a while since I’d seen &lt;em&gt;Age of Ultron&lt;/em&gt;? Luckily, that turns out not to be the case. Characters, at least the ones that matter, are winnowed down over time and managed mostly through dialog and plotting, rather than exposition. And really, when you come to see this film, you come for the dialog and plotting. But you might stay for the set and costume design. And the superb performance from Kate Beckinsale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beckinsale carries the film. She is surrounded by some broad shouldered men but make no mistake, she can turn them all on her dainty little finger. The scenes between her and Chloë Sevigny are brilliant. Their delicious gossip is all the more delicious because you feel like you’re in on it with them. The film also has something of a frog boiling in a pot of water feel to it. By that I mean, the humor gets broader, louder and funnier as the film goes on. What started as giggles in the theater turned into outright guffaws by the final act. For a film about conservative 1790s aristocracy, I had about as much fun watching it as I did watching &lt;em&gt;Keanu&lt;/em&gt; earlier this month. That’s not small accomplishment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not as familiar with other works from Stillman but from what I gather this Austen adaptation was something of an inevitability. In some ways, then, I’m glad this was my introduction to him. I look forward to going back into his archives to see what other ways he has adapted, interpreted and modernized Austen’s writing, whether focusing on the humor, the class politics, the moral absolutism, or something else entirely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jacques Audiard had a fan in me with his 2009 &lt;em&gt;Un Prophet&lt;/em&gt;. It’s a film I think about often, years after its release and only having seen it once. In fact, last year Ryan Coogler referenced it in an &lt;a href=&quot;http://variety.com/video/ryan-cooglers-speech-on-diversity-and-film-criticism/&quot;&gt;award speech&lt;/a&gt;, further endearing me to him and adding to his charm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I never caught up with &lt;em&gt;Rust and Bone&lt;/em&gt; in 2012, but when I saw that Audiard was back this year with &lt;em&gt;Dheepan&lt;/em&gt; my interest was piqued. Then I learned it had central characters who were Sri Lankan, connected to the Tamil Tigers. Then it won the Palm d’Or. My interest was maximally piqued. I caught up with it this weekend and my expectations were met and exceeded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The film has great acting, a terrifically tight and well-plotted story, direction and photography. The less-than-believable finale didn’t bother me but I can see why some viewers might be turned off by it. But to focus on the finale would be to deny the film its biggest accomplishment - building a fantastically interesting family at the center, at once immersed in violence and trying to make a new life as refugees in a new country. That the LTTE/Sri Lanka conflict has not been used to tell more stories remains a mystery, but Audiard brought it to the screen with vigor. Although we only get a few minutes in Sri Lanka with these characters, their plight is abundantly clear. As are the stakes of making it all work in France. Then you add the layers of war, filial relations, unemployment, cultural clashes and so on. A long list might make the film sound over-wrought or uncentered but it is supremely centered on one story, using all these things to bring gravitas to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not only is this film fascinating as a singular story, the geo-political threads are fascinating as well. The depiction of refugee life, the present role of violence, terror and militarism, the treatment of immigrants in a Western country like France, language and cultural barriers; all of these features add so much to the film.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Audiard did enough to win a life time of admiration from me in 2009 with &lt;em&gt;Un Prophet&lt;/em&gt; and now with &lt;em&gt;Dheepan&lt;/em&gt;, he is seriously contending for a spot in my list of all time favorite film makers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I saw the director’s cut of &lt;em&gt;Blade Runner&lt;/em&gt; at the Museum of the Moving Image earlier this week. This was my first time seeing the director’s cut, which clearly seems to be the superior version of the film. The missing narration, editing choices and overall ambiguity of the film serves the story much better than a more on-the-nose edit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The screening also featured a Q and A with one of the original screenwriters, Hampton Fancher. Fancher was a hilarious personality, sharing many stories about the film-making process for this film in particular and in Hollywood in general. During the session, I asked him about the infamous scene between Deckard and Rachael, during their first intimate encounter. I asked whether Fancher had any thoughts about the discussions over the years about sexual abuse between Deckard and Rachael, whether the mention of rape had any bearing, in his opinion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His response, paraphrased, was that there was definitely some evil stuff going on in that scene. The ambiguity was intentional, both from the writers and the director. They wanted to play up the sexual politics and add a seed of doubt about Deckard’s character. But he also admitted that in those days, women likely felt like they were aboard an all male pirate ship. The environment and culture of movie sets was very masculine and probably very unfriendly for women. He suggested that pulling off a scene like that today would require a lot more justification and thought from the film-makers than it did in 1982 when this film was released.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I appreciated his thoughtful and honest response to the question. While asking the question I gave him the option to decline to answer because it is a hot-button issue and I didn’t mean to put him on the spot if he wasn’t prepared. But he was gracious in taking the question seriously and sharing a thoughtful answer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I made the mistake of seeing &lt;em&gt;A Bigger Splash&lt;/em&gt; at a giant mega-multi-plex theater in Times Square. My first mistake was being in Times Square to start with, but as a means of respite, I thought I’d pop in during an afternoon walk to see this film. In this context, a film about hedonism, ignorance, passion and pleasure was just begging for my eye rolls. Seeing hordes of consumerist tourists, feeling alienated and disconnected from my own city, left me wanting for connection and genuine emotion. I couldn’t stand any of the characters, they’re all unlikable. The natural lighting felt indulgent, instead of artistic. The rustic Italian landscapes felt exploitative instead of celebratory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know other viewers took all these things as they were meant - dramatic satire, but I just couldn’t get there with this film. I had a similar experience last year with Angelina Jolie’s &lt;em&gt;By The Sea&lt;/em&gt;. The friend with whom I saw the movie couldn’t stand the characters, found nothing redeemable about the film. I, maybe because I was in a different place, found some of the ideas about beauty, jealousy, and loneliness interesting. Sometimes you just catch the wrong movie and the wrong time in the wrong place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Barkley Marathons&lt;/em&gt; is an unassuming, stripped down documentary, not interested in being flashy. But still, it aspires something slightly more ever-lasting. In this way, it is like Gary “Lazarus Lake” Cantrell, the figure at the center of it all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The film-makers lucked out by finding three runners upon whom they could focus. These runners also ran very interesting races, two highly competitive and a third less competitive but somehow more meaningful as a racer. The story they built from these races ends up being equal parts impressive (the sheer physical accomplishment is worth your consideration) and entertaining (if for no other reason, because of the cast of characters, mostly white men, that this race draws). As a runner myself, I found some parts of this documentary particularly relatable, but even for non-runners there’s enough to keep your attention for the short runtime.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lords of Finance&lt;/em&gt; is eminently deserving of its 2013 Pulitzer for non-fiction. Liaquat Ahamed has written a forward moving and captivating text about a seemingly dry subject (macro-economics) by grounding it in fascinating characters. The 4 protagonists, a cast of rotating bankers (mostly white men, but that’s who was in power) and especially John Maynard Keynes make for fascinating pegs upon which to hang this hugely important story. The mystery, character, plotting and development of this book rivals some of the best works of fiction in the last few years. Although some of the economic concepts were foreign to me, I never felt lost. Ahamed does a great job of introducing and grounding simple and complex ideas, alike, all in service of the story. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I look forward to finding more works of history and non-fiction like this.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://letterboxd.com/samarthbhaskar/film/green-room/&quot;&gt;LetterboxD review link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Blue Ruin&lt;/em&gt; was one of my favorite films of 2013. I was immediately impressed with Macon Blair and Jeremy Saulnier. Going in to &lt;em&gt;Green Room&lt;/em&gt;, I had no idea they were back together and going further down the path of exploring violence. I was hesitant to see this film, in all honesty, because the trailer made it seem like a horror or gore filled film, the kind I usually stay away from. But as soon as Macon Blair came on screen, my attention was focused.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Green Room&lt;/em&gt; is a seat-gripping ride that takes little time to turn up to 9, then 10, then 11. The use of violence was central to this film. Violence, in and of itself, is sometimes interesting but it becomes all the more interesting when it is used in service of something larger. Saulnier seems to be using violence as a method of exploring humanity in this film. He is focused on how violence compounds on itself, how it relies on a failure of humanity, and what it means for us to aspire morality while violence exists all around us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Green Room&lt;/em&gt; accomplished some of these things better than others, but Saulnier is well suited for success in this vein. As long as he keeps partnering with Macon Blair, who is perhaps one of the best conduits for morality and violence acting today.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://letterboxd.com/samarthbhaskar/film/captain-america-civil-war/&quot;&gt;LetterboxD review link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First and foremost, &lt;em&gt;Captain America: Civil War&lt;/em&gt; works as blockbuster, summer, popcorn entertainment. It features great action sequences, Spider Man and Ant Man provide levity, the pacing (while sometimes erratic) is generally well suited for audiences of all ages. But it’s biggest success is in balancing 12 major superheroes (superheroines? supersheroes?), a plot, character development, exposition and franchise(s) in one film. As you might expect, this makes for a slightly over-wrought, slightly over-long, 4-act film. By and large, though, the filmmakers pull it off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Between &lt;em&gt;Batman Vs Superman&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Captain America: Civil War&lt;/em&gt; and what I can gather from trailers of &lt;em&gt;XMen: Apocalypse&lt;/em&gt; there’s a lot of consternation going on about in-fighting in America. Film-makers aren’t entirely wrong to pull on this thread in a time when our country seems to be eating its own tail. But hardly any film has done a great job at taking this premise somewhere interesting. I suppose this is easy to say sitting here, looking back on films from the 70s and 80s that leveraged Cold War themes with the US mostly winning out in the end. Few films have been able to come up with a conclusion to the America falling apart storyline that seems even remotely inspired.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As others have been noting, this is not much more than an extended Key &amp;amp; Peele sketch. But as any fan of their show knows, that’s reason enough to show up. They mine some interesting identity issues, but never with as much acuity as some of their best sketches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, this was a good first foray into film-making. I look forward to more films from Key and Peele in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Spirited Away</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://letterboxd.com/samarthbhaskar/film/spirited-away/&quot;&gt;LetterboxD review link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The beginning sequence of &lt;em&gt;Spirited Away&lt;/em&gt; shows a small family moving to a new town. Their daughter, Chihiro, is in the back seat, lamenting the move, wholly unexcited about her new life. This sentiment has been explored in other films, the most recent one that comes to mind is &lt;em&gt;Inside Out&lt;/em&gt;. But there’s something about how Miyazaki and the makers of &lt;em&gt;Spirited Away&lt;/em&gt; capture this experience that felt hyper-real to me. Chihiro’s eye-rolls, her parents’ distant love and constant chatter, the moment the window opens and Chihiro has to seat up and deal with the reality. That scene transported me back to every move I had to make as a child. Immediately, I felt a kinship with Chihiro, an animated pre-teen girl in Japan who is about to go on a escapist, dream-like adventure in a monster theme park. That’s some magical cinema.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rest of the film takes off from this point into new, imaginative, exciting (and sometimes exhausting) directions. There are times when some of the action or plot points make you feel like something was lost in translation, perhaps from Japanese culture, folklore or myth, but for the most part the film is full of full and fascinating characters.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I was recently thinking about great films set in a single location. Films like &lt;em&gt;Rosemarie’s Baby&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Moon&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Dogtooth&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Clerks&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Clue&lt;/em&gt; came to mind. Magda Szabo’s &lt;em&gt;The Door&lt;/em&gt; could be considered a book set in a single location. Although we get a few changes of scenery and a few major plot points, the book largely progresses by revealing more about the two central characters - Magda and Emerence. Of Emerence, we learn more and more about her past, why she became the person she is, and what motivates her to live her life as a laconic, but also acerbic, house keeper. Similarly, we learn about Magda’s religiosity, her writing, her relationship with her husband and her unending interest in knowing more about Emerence. All of this is unraveled through beautiful writing, translated from its original Hungarian.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A through line can be found between this book and Elana Ferrante’s Neopolitan series. Not only because at the center of these two novels is a friendship between two fascinating women, but also because we explore this relationship through the eyes of only one of the participants, and we spend most of our time fascinated (on behalf of the narrator) by the character who isn’t speaking for herself. In Ferrante’s &lt;em&gt;My Brilliant Best Friend&lt;/em&gt; we get a portrait of childhood and young-adulthood. In &lt;em&gt;The Door&lt;/em&gt; we get deeper, more colorful life almost entirely because we’re dealing with complicated adults, with complicated past lives. For my money, this was a far more interesting book.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In a few of the reviews I’ve read of The Argonauts, reviewers tend to describe Maggie Nelson’s writing as “defying definition.” Allow me to try anyway. The book reads like it is perpetually in the middle of the most interesting conversation you’ve had in years. It can at once make you feel like you’re in office hours with one of your favorite professors, or having beers with a friend you respect, or remembering a conversation you had in your formative years that forever changed your world view about a topic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Argonauts has been described as a book about motherhood, but it is more than that. It is part criticism, part poetry, part memoir, but perhaps overall a book about love. You can piece together a narrative, even though there’s no plot (if that doesn’t speak to the quality of writing, I don’t know what more to tell you). I haven’t read a lot of queer theory, I’m passingly familiar with it, but this was a great introduction to some of the most interesting issues of identity at play in that literary/critical tradition. Lest that make the experience sound too clinical, I also cared about the author and the people in her life. As someone who builds meaning from both emotion and intellectualism, Nelson’s approach to making meaning from her experiences spoke to me greatly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition to these attributes, my favorite part of the book was the lack of certainty. There is no resolution in the book about gender, marriage, parenthood, professionalism, family, sex, child-birth, death. What we get instead is a window into the mind of a smart woman dealing with all these things in the modern world. She engages with writers, with the institutions as they exist in her life, with her own reservations, with the thoughts and feelings of her partner, all the competing interests in her life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a long list of authors and works I’m going to check out as a result of reading this book (I loved the citations right next to the text), but none with more urgency than more of Nelson’s work.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Miles Ahead</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://letterboxd.com/samarthbhaskar/film/miles-ahead/&quot;&gt;LetterboxD review link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the end credits of &lt;em&gt;Miles Ahead&lt;/em&gt;, Don Cheadle, as Miles Davis, jams with Robert Glasper, Gary Clark, Wayne Shorter, Esparanza Spaulding and Herbie Hancock. I wanted to watch that jam session for hours. In those 5 or 6 minutes, I got more joy, feeling and emotionality than the rest of the film combined. That’s not to say there weren’t good moments in the film, but in its attempt at an impressionistic version of a biopic, it failed to land some of its punches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cheadle, as writer, director and actor, clearly had his mind set on a film that drew more formal and structural inspiration from its subject than biographic detail. Cheadle set out to create a film that had the genre innovation of Miles Davis’ music. The film is jazz-like in its lack of adherence to convention. But what Cheadle was attempting may just have been impossible to accomplish in a mass-market Hollywood biopic. What Davis accomplished as a musician, Cheadle was not able to accomplish as a film maker. That’s an absurdly high bar to set and an impossible standard to achieve, I admit, but it would be unfair not to evaluate this film for what it was trying to accomplish. Cheadle’s acting was phenomenal, the music sublime, but little else rose to the occasion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I originally wrote a longer review of this film that lobbed insults like “anodyne”, “politically bereft”, “lacking a point of view” and “unsure who it is for or what it is about”. But then I took a few days to think about it and came down on the side of “who cares”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Billy Murray’s baloo is funny and heart-warming, Ben Kingsley’s bagheera is reserved and intellectual. Neel Sethi’s acting will make you believe that Jacob Tremblay in &lt;em&gt;Room&lt;/em&gt; really is in a category of his own as a child actor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a story, and an episode of history, this is one of the most fascinating. The politics of gender, race, class, power and media are all at play in this story. They reach out and grab the listener’s attention from the first minute. It’s easy to wonder what our country and supreme court would look like if this had worked out differently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But as a narrative, &lt;em&gt;Confirmation&lt;/em&gt; comes off heavy-handed. It tries too hard to seem even-handed. With so much “on one hand, on the other,” it ends up largely falling flat for the viewer. The lead performances are strong, but the writing and story telling is not sharp.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With that being said, I have two questions: (1) did newscasters in the 90s not know how to pronounce harassment? and (2) why did no one cast Greg Kinnear as Joe Biden until now?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of the many themes that show up over and again in the Coen Brothers’ filmography, one of my favorites is the idea that there’s no hell or after-life. Hell is here, on earth. You pay for your sins before you die.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Blood Simple&lt;/em&gt; may be the best summation of this theme. The tone is set from the beginning but there’s a particular shot when Marty, responding to Meurice, says “I’m going to stay right here in hell, tonight.” We go many places throughout the rest of the film, but we never really leave hell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new Metrograph theater in NYC screened a 35MM version of &lt;em&gt;My Neighbor Totoro&lt;/em&gt; this weekend. Miyazaki, Studio Ghibli, and this film in particular are a testament to the power of narrative. There is very little going on in this movie, it features a narrative constructed largely out of nothing. The only real powering force behind it is imagination. There is no major conflict, we learn only a little about their mother’s illness, and yet every viewer in the theater, young and old, was focused on the story and pulling for these characters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Satsuki and Mei are some of Miyazaki’s best characters. They are full of warmth, wonder, and intelligence. Their father, too, is a great character. He gives his full love, trust and attention to his daughters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some stories or films that are so saccharine and unobjectionable, lacking any conflict or trying to be so unoffensive to anyone that they lose all meaning. This film could’ve ended up like that. But instead it ends up with a politics of its own - a politics that is heavily in favor of imagination and family.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Something, Anything&lt;/em&gt;’s set design was impressive. It captured what so much of middle-America looks like. The bath towels, the faux art from Michael’s or Hobby Lobby, tea cups, knives, forks and spoons from Ikea or Bed, Bath and Beyond. The 5-8 year old cars. Clothes from Kohl’s. It’s not so easy to capture on screen things that tend to just bleed into background in our lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond that, and maybe the central performance by Ashley Shelton, there wasn’t much that I found impressive about this film.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Karan Mahajan’s &lt;em&gt;The Association of Small Bombs&lt;/em&gt; is thoughtful, well constructed novel built from great ideas. But it narrowly misses a 4 or 5 star rating, largely because it fails to rise above its great ideas, into a well plotted, complete story. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mahajan, unlike many writers who take on terrorism as a topic, doesn’t shy away from difficult questions. How does radicalization happen? Why is radical Islam denied political agency? What role does sexual violence play in terrorism? How does terror, which can also be called fear, manifest in the body of its victims, before, during and after an attack? What place to victims of smaller attacks have in a world that focuses on big events in select places? In writing about these ideas, he captures contemporary New Delhi, class relations, religious relations nicely. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although the characters and their conflicts are interesting, the plot and story don’t come together well enough to move this past a set of interesting ideas and some pretty good writing. The ending also feels like a too-short fuse lit and left to explode. But instead of watching or feeling the explosion, the reader simply walks away, with no real sense of completion. As unfair as it may seem, endings matter in good story telling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Trisha&lt;/em&gt;, the debut feature by Trey Edward Shults, which he wrote, directed and edited, is a remarkable first feature. His experience as an intern on some Terrence Mallick sets is apparent, if only in a few shots of the night sky in suburban Texas. In filming a chamber-piece-family-addiction-character-drama, Shults has added his voice to an exciting new crop of young directors on the festival circuit this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lead performance, in fact all the performances (largely by family members, non-professional actors), are instrumental to the success of this film. Shults put a lot of trust into his actors and it paid off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For me, the most impressive aspect of this film was that Shults mined his personal life for drama, and it resulted in a hyper-real, suspenseful, seemingly mundane, but in fact highly cinematic piece of art. Texans, like Shults and Linklater, it seems sure know how to make the mundane interesting. Maybe it’s the vast expanses of space, and extra physical distance between people. They have to find ways to embed drama and intrigue where it’s usually missing. There’s not exactly a narrative here, not more than one you could summarize in a sentence or two. We mostly follow a compassionate author as he films a character sliding down a dangerous slope, and the family around her along for the ride. The raw, intimate, honest portrait we get in return is probably partially true of Shults’ own life, but definitely true of the lives of many families dealing with each other around the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn’t connect emotionally with this film as much as &lt;em&gt;Tree of Life&lt;/em&gt;, but I think that’s partly because this film is about midlife crises. I haven’t had one of those yet. To me, it is the work of a man looking back at a midlife crisis. Maybe Mallick went through a crisis like this himself, or more likely, he is telegraphing the crises of Hollywood men around him, but generally we get a picture of a man trying to fill his life with things he thinks will help him. With women, mostly. But also with partying and work. All the while we get some beautiful imagery and a fluid, captivating score. And a hopeful ending that solves his problems largely by just asking him to “begin.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not entirely sure about this point, but there’s a possibility that Mallick in the last few years has started making films every 2-3 years instead of every 8, and each has some anxieties about modernity at its core. Perhaps by churning films out this way, Mallick is exercising his anxieties about modernity through the most modern of mediums (or at least the most capitalist), production. Perhaps his way of coping with a world from he feels largely alienated is to lean in to the alienation. The problem with this theory is that we can’t really know if it’s the case until he’s done making films. Until we can look back on eras in his work and consider this era we’re in as a whole. That’s the inherent irony in any organizing theory about the present, we need the distance of time to know if it holds up. What I can say with a little more confidence is that Mallick is not entirely at home in the modern world. And that is something he shares in common with many millions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes an author finds source material so interesting and remarkable on its face, they forget to do the work of finding something noteworthy to say about it. The family at the center of &lt;em&gt;The Wolfpack&lt;/em&gt; is remarkable in and of itself. But I would think that if I read about them in the Metro section of the New York Times. To make a feature length documentary, the author needed to ask and (at least partially) answer some questions, that ultimately, she never gets to in this film.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found many parts of the film fascinating - from the brothers’ relationships with each other, with their mother, to their burgeoning rejection of their father, and of course their fascination with films (especially Tarantino and Nolan, arguably some of the most masculine film makers, making movies for young men). But there was so much more I wanted to know about their father, who largely gets off the hook here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I should begin by copping to the fact that I’m a Richard Linklater fan. I loved &lt;em&gt;Boyhood&lt;/em&gt;, the &lt;em&gt;Midnight&lt;/em&gt; trilogy, &lt;em&gt;Slackers&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Bernie&lt;/em&gt;. I even thought &lt;em&gt;A Scanner Darkly&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;School of Rock&lt;/em&gt; were fine. Although I like it, I wouldn’t say &lt;em&gt;Dazed and Confused&lt;/em&gt; was my favorite of his work but I might have to revise that now in conjunction with &lt;em&gt;Everybody Wants Some!!&lt;/em&gt;. In a year full of dour political news, dour films, dour literature, this film is unabashed, sweet, fun. It doesn’t go too deep on philosophical lines of thought too often, but the few scenes that go there are great. It’s not a character study or a heavily plotted film, perhaps a study of relationships or of an epoch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The epoch and the relationships at the center of this film feel entirely familiar to Linklater. He spent a short stint in college playing baseball. Although I’m less removed from my first weekend of college than Linklater, I remember it with the same strength as it seems Linklater remembers his. Those first days are so full of emotion, excitement, nerves and anxiety, it’s clear why they borough into our heads for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of that aside, this film is downright fun. It is the most I’ve laughed, the most fun I’ve had at a movie since &lt;em&gt;Magic Mike XXL&lt;/em&gt;. Like &lt;em&gt;Mike&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Everybody Wants Some!!&lt;/em&gt; is interested in masculinity. It has just as much fun taking a group of fun loving guys, through a romp around the south, building from party to party. The men in these movies are up for anything, they’re open, adventurous, and yes, perhaps hyper-sexualized, but it works. There’s room for more “everybody’s” in the “Everybody” in this title (basically non-white men), but it hardly feels right to penalize them for it. Maybe what they’re doing instead, is opening up masculinity. Instead of masculinity defined by boundaries of what is and isn’t allowed, maybe the masculinity we see here is a new possible masculinity - that cherishes male relationships, is open to the new and adventurous, while being less worried about deriving power through violence or constricted sexuality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a long, hectic day, I found &lt;em&gt;I used to be darker&lt;/em&gt; to be just the kind of movie I needed. Matthew Porterfield did a lot with very little in this film. The film felt like a short story, adapted for the screen by a director who was intent on staying out of the way. Porterfield’s directing choices (staying far away from the main characters, leaving the camera an arm’s length away, depicting beautifully messy interiors) reflect the characters themselves. Everyone in this film is longing for love and acceptance, but somehow everyone comes up just short. The acting, paired with this writing and directing, makes for a beautiful package. This film has all the qualities of the platonic ideal of indie cinema.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two moments in the film that affected me the most were the two solo music performances. Together, they made up some of my favorite music moments in film that I can remember. I would even go as far as to say they were as moving as the end of &lt;em&gt;Phoenix&lt;/em&gt;, which if you’ve seen the film, is high praise.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Blue Velvet</title>

&lt;p&gt;There is nothing easy about &lt;em&gt;Blue Velvet&lt;/em&gt;. I had always thought this, and known this, about David Lynch. It took me a while to see this film, for whatever reason. I saw it in a reprint at the Film Forum in NYC recently. Of the Lynch films I’ve seen, this was the most fun to watch, the easiest, the most formal but as any one can guess, that doesn’t mean much for David Lynch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m likely not going to add anything new to the many exegeses of this film that have been written since its release. The most impressive thing about the movie to me, is how complicated it is. It is a noir-film, but complicates noir. It is a film about masculinity, that complicated masculinity. It features some grotesque abuse, that complicates the roles of victim and perpetrator. Nothing in this film is what it seems. But Lynch also isn’t just depicting some sort of hand-wringing “boy, golly, I don’t know” sort of post-modernist false equivalency or relativist thing. He is very clear on what he believes about these things, about masculinity, about sex, power and American self-image. That’s not to say he’s definitive, just that his beliefs are very clearly on display.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;“Most houses are haunted by humans not ghosts”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the acknowledgements at the end of her book, Angela Flournoy, a remarkably adept, mature debut writer, lists some works of history and oral history that capture Detroit through the 20th century. I would say this book belongs in any anthology meant to capture life in Detroit, or America, in contemporary times. Throughout the book, through some simple math, we can ascertain what era we’re in, near the end there’s even a mention of a historic election (Barack Obama’s in 2008) to help situate the reader. But the real location of this book is in the middle of a family’s current generation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can imagine that for some readers some of the book’s action that takes place in therapy sessions, or some of the dialog between family members that finds them discussing feelings or drawing connections may be too on the nose. In my estimation, Flournoy pulled off these moments through her sharp writing, and because the inner lives of her characters are well built throughout the other parts of the book.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With all that praise in mind, I will say something I found missing in this book was a sense of enthralling action or dynamism in emotions. Throughout almost the entire book, I hardly felt swells of emotions because of what a character was experiencing or captured by ideas of what could happen next. There’s plenty to be excited about in Flournoy’s writing, but I could’ve used some more plotting and some more variety in emotions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even after reading all the reviews, I went to go see this film. And now I’m like Dennis Green: THEY ARE WHO WE THOUGHT THEY WERE!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This does not cross into “it’s so bad it’s good” territory. It is firmly in “it’s so bad” territory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After seeing &lt;em&gt;Magic Mike XXL&lt;/em&gt; recently, I have high expectations for sequels. Especially sequels that don’t have much to prove. I enjoyed Pitch Perfect 2 (my own acappella background and embarrassment notwithstanding), but it could’ve gone in a much more subversive direction. They had some fun with tropes about women-led comedies, but I think they could’ve done more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regardless, Rebel Wilson steals the show, and the others aren’t far behind. And more of Keegan Michael Key in everything please.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://letterboxd.com/samarthbhaskar/film/midnight-special/&quot;&gt;LetterboxD review link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is plenty to like (Michael Shannon and Joel Edgerton, the first act, an imaginative incorporation of the Warren Jeffs-type story, Nichols’ ability to bring emotion to the fore in deceptively simple ways, some great use of darkness) and not like (the third act, Nichols’ continued inability to deliver on promising premises with dramatic endings, a less impressive use of imagery than his work in &lt;em&gt;Take Shelter&lt;/em&gt;, an ending that imagines alien landscapes you could see on display in Dubai or Abu-Dhabi right now). Other reviewers have discussed these and other themes admirably. I won’t rehash those things here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, I’d like to focus on the portrait of fatherhood and father-son relations that this film displays. Nichols shows a beautiful relationship between Alton and Roy. There are times when Roy’s worrying almost crosses into anger, but he quickly recoils. Moments that in most father-son relationships would result in a lecture (or maybe worse) are characterized by a loving look, holding Alton closely, or putting himself in harm’s way to keep Alton safe. I imagine every father hopes to be this kind of a father. Especially if you have a sick or special-needs son, you hope to provide this sort of protection and love for him. Rarely, though, do most fathers see themselves live up to this standard. With this amount of consistency. Rightfully, we don’t get too many flashbacks into Roy or Alton’s lives, but the way they are with each other, I couldn’t help but imagine this is how they’ve always been.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is another kind of father in this film, namely the character played by Sam Shepard. This more authoritarian, distant version of a father is someone we’re more used to seeing. But I’m glad Nichols stuck with the depiction of Roy as fully loving and committed, instead of compromising him for the sake of realism.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I’ve always heard great things about &lt;em&gt;Debt&lt;/em&gt;, and I still plan on reading it. I fear, though, that &lt;em&gt;Utopia of Rules&lt;/em&gt; may not have been a great introduction to the work of David Graeber. As social science, it is weak, lacking in strong evidence, meandering and unstructured. As social commentary, it is unfunny and only slightly insightful. If this was Graeber’s attempt at a Zizek-esque media critique, he missed the mark by quite a bit. Some examples are more on the mark than others. I’m thinking, in particular, about the James Bond vs. Sherlock Holmes dichotomy, the exploration of fantasy, the relationship between magic and law. But most of the other examples, the passages about Star Trek, about games vs play, about “The Dark Knight”, and so on are meandering, lacking structure and ultimately do not build the core argument of the book.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To make the topics he has chosen for this book interesting, Graeber has done a pretty good job. But not enough to rise above the level of novelty. At the end, I came away convinced that there is something worth exploring in the role of bureaucracy in America or democracy, but not that Graeber had done a very good job exploring it. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are more and more outlets for popular versions of academic social science. You can read about history through Ta’nehisi Coates. Ezra Klein, Nate Silver and Henry Farrel do a good job popularizing political science. Psychology and economics are all over NPR and it’s subsidiary podcasts like Freakonomics and Planet Money. There isn’t, however, a natural place for this kind of popular home for sociology and anthropology. In so far as this book brings these ideas to a popular audience, it is somewhat successful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Spy&lt;/em&gt; is a good plane movie. I didn’t see it on a plane, but it’s got the makings of a good plane movie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was generally on board in the first half, taking a liking to both the character and the plot that was building around her. But when she takes an abrupt turn in the second half I was less sold. I don’t mean to imply that McCarthy should only play the nice midwesterner, entirely harmless, just that the caustic, rough edged turn felt like it belonged in a different movie. Her character in &lt;em&gt;Bridesmaids&lt;/em&gt;, for comparison, worked much better, both within the ensemble and the tone of the film.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve read a few reviews that start with “don’t read anything about this film, see it context free first.” Thankfully, I read these reviews after seeing &lt;em&gt;10 Cloverfield Lane&lt;/em&gt;. Even the fantastic, faux montage trailer, which I saw after the film was much better post-viewing than it would’ve been before. I never saw the first &lt;em&gt;Cloverfield&lt;/em&gt; but I don’t think it was my kind of film. Thankfully, this film has little to nothing to do with the first. It merely uses the &lt;em&gt;Cloverfield&lt;/em&gt; branding as a jumping off point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;10 Cloverfield Lane&lt;/em&gt; is a self-contained entertainment capsule. It doesn’t reach too far beyond its grasp, it paces things, including a great montage, a couple of important reveals and a properly short final encounter sequence quite well. The sense of balance, coupled with good acting (John Goodman can do no wrong in my book, though) makes for a good time. I don’t think this will be a memorable film, but not every film has to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was excited to see Damien Chazelle’s name come up during credits. Not that I have much to go off besides &lt;em&gt;Whiplash&lt;/em&gt;, but his influence seemed minimal on this script. Regardless, I’m gunning for more writing credits for him.&lt;/p&gt;

   <id>/books/a-manual-for-cleaning-women-selected-stories</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It was difficult to not compare &lt;em&gt;A Manual for Cleaning Women&lt;/em&gt; to other short story collections I’ve recently, especially &lt;em&gt;Pastoralia&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Fortune Smiles&lt;/em&gt;, both of which were stellar. Berlin, in comparison, comes up a little short in her ability to impress in terms of raw wisdom or intellect. Where she excels in the quality of writing. I’ve heard her described as a “writer’s writer,” which is a phrase I don’t fully understand but I can see applied to Berlin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At many points while reading the stories in this book, I found my attention straying. After a train ride or a weekend reading session, I had a hard time remembering what exactly I read just then. I didn’t find myself looking forward to picking up the book the next day to see what more I could learn. This could be related to the lack of plotting or characters, or the usual scaffolding I’m provided as a reader. There were a handful of stories that had me rapt, where each page turn was paired with a dreadful feeling of “oh please don’t let this be the end of it.” Those stories, along with Berlin’s writing, are enough for me to say I like (not love) this book.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another feeling I kept thinking about, (I believe one of the commenters on Slate’s ABC podcast also mentioned this), was that this book made it difficult for me to get absorbed and go on long journeys with each chapter, character, plot or scene. So many of the stories are short, abrupt or disjointed that the reading experience mirrors a session of web browsing where one open tab follows another, with little connective tissue and mostly a feeling of distraction not of commitment. I tend to read novels and literary fiction to get away from that feeling. Whatever her reason, Berlin’s choice in writing short stories this way made if difficult for me to achieve a kind of closeness with the book that I look forward to when I crack open a new work.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://letterboxd.com/samarthbhaskar/film/triple-9/&quot;&gt;LetterboxD review link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Triple 9&lt;/em&gt; features an impressive cast (Winslet, Ejiofor, Affleck, Harrelson, Mackey), a few worthwhile performances (Affleck and Harrelson), about three well-executed action sequences and not much else. The rest of the film is mired in cliché, refuses to invest in plot or character development and shows a director and cinematographer seemingly just trying stuff without any cohesive rhyme or reason.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kate Winslet seems to basically recycle her accent from &lt;em&gt;Steve Jobs&lt;/em&gt;, going from a Polish émigré to a Russian jewish matriarch. Anthony Mackey and Casey Affleck make a little more out of their roles than their colleagues, but not by much. Harrelson, when he’s not saddled with the unexplained burden of being a drug addict, also rises above the fray.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, John Hillcoat paints a bleak world. He was successful with a similar approach in &lt;em&gt;The Road&lt;/em&gt;, but is much less successful here. It’s possible this story could’ve been better as a miniseries or a season of TV, it certainly could have rescued the 3rd act. But I don’t think I would’ve been that excited to watch that, either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Girl on the Train&lt;/em&gt; is purportedly about an idea. What is the anatomy of a lie? When does it succeed? When does it fail? And what is interesting about each kind of a lie: a successful one or a failing one? That’s an interesting premise, but this film doesn’t quite turn it into an interesting story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Magic Mike XXL&lt;/em&gt; is an incredibly fun movie. Having seen, and liked the first &lt;em&gt;Magic Mike&lt;/em&gt;, I was expecting something slightly darker, more socially minded, or even more plotted. Instead, I found myself laughing out loud, gasping and yelling at the screen while watching one vignette after another of long, expertly choreographed dance scenes, beautiful Soderbergh-ian cinematography, dialog and plot that didn’t take itself too seriously, but also didn’t devolve into being goofy or dumb.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am endlessly impressed with the slight-of-hand trick that the filmmakers pulled in this movie. Audiences going in to &lt;em&gt;Magic Mike XXL&lt;/em&gt; probably do not expect a film that celebrates female sexuality, respects women, shows (without sensationalizing) diverse body types and non-traditional relationships or men participating in drag shows without threats to their identities. Certainly there’s still plenty more we could ask for. For example, for men to not consider themselves “healers” for merely listening to women. For a fuller, more complete treatment of race. But every movie doesn’t have to accomplish every thing. What this movie accomplishes is a great start.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I should reiterate, again, that this movie is a bag of fun, before it is anything else. The dancing alone is worth the price of admission. I look forward to getting more examples of good, clean, unadulterated fun at the movies that doesn’t rely on dumbing things down or rely on making fun of someone.&lt;/p&gt;

   <id>/books/a-confederacy-of-dunces</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Confederacy of Dunces&lt;/em&gt; is a satirical, farcical, often very funny novel, but one that mostly lacks an emotional or moral core until the last few pages. I don’t often read satire in this vein so I can’t properly situate this novel in its genre, but in comparison to more literary works, I found myself missing the less ironic, more wise parts of a story. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that said, the crisp, witty, writing, the portrait of 1950s New Orleans, the real-life story of the author’s suicide and posthumous publication and fame are all redeeming qualities of this book.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This assumption is not exactly based on a wide survey, mostly just reviews and ratings here on Goodreads, but &lt;em&gt;Confederacy&lt;/em&gt; seems like a novel well built for straight, white, well-to-do men to like. No group of people believes more strongly that they are misunderstood geniuses, surrounded by idiots, and if only they were given the respect they deserved, everyone would see their charm and genius. I was hoping the author, John Kennedy Toole, would get around to lifting the curtain on Ignatius, but I think he was actually just in love with the pompous, overzealous, judgmental version of his character. In addition, Toole portrayed one-sided caricatures of black and poor characters. I just couldn’t find where the satire and irony would meet something more meaningful and grounded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;99 Homes&lt;/em&gt; is a great companion to, and in my opinion a better film than &lt;em&gt;The Big Short&lt;/em&gt;. It depicts the story of the financial crisis that I’m far more interested in. Namely, the devastation and mayhem felt by every day people around the country, in towns small and large. How big financial institutions went through the crisis is also interesting, but I’m not nearly as moved by it as this story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Michael Shannon is a commanding presence on screen. His acting here is on par with his best work, which previously was an accolade reserved solely for &lt;em&gt;Taking Shelter&lt;/em&gt;. Ramin Bahrani, after receiving attention from the likes of Roger Ebert, is living up to his promise by writing and making films like this. I am looking forward to seeing how his career takes shape over the next years and decades.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For some viewers, the ending may be off putting enough to ruin the whole experience. Though I agree that it could’ve been sharper, I found enough to like about the first 7/8 of the movie that the last 1/8 didn’t turn me off entirely.&lt;/p&gt;

   <id>/books/the-good-lord-bird</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Good Lord Bird&lt;/em&gt; is a deceptive novel. Upon first finishing it, I felt a deep sense of apathy. I kept thinking things like why don’t I care about any of these characters? Why am I so unmoved by the story? It depicts an important moment in American history, a direct precursor to the Civil War, so why can’t I get excited about it? But now I find those are incomplete evaluations of the book. In general, yes, I didn’t find myself moved by the characters, I didn’t find myself impressed by the action.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I was also fascinated by the race and gender dynamics of the book. I found myself, over a few days after completing the book, thinking about why only black people know Onion was a boy. Did John Brown know all along too? I found myself thinking about religious extremism, in the case of someone like Brown who invoked religion at every corner and used it to justify violence. About the depiction of Frederick Douglass, that did not match how I’ve thought about or learned to think about Douglass until now. About whether Onion was in fact an unreliable narrator, remembering his life at an old age. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Good Lord Bird&lt;/em&gt; is undeniably a smart book. It is packed full of beautiful, poetic, picaresque writing. It brings to bear a black man’s perspective on a white man’s attempt at ending slavery, a sorely missing perspective from most of literature. It is all these things, but it failed to grab me emotionally. And that is something, in my opinion, that great art needs to accomplish, to differentiate itself from an academic exercise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mustang&lt;/em&gt;, a directorial debut from Turkish born French director Deniz Gamze Ergüven is a soulful, beautifully written and shot coming of age story that is sure to burrow its way into viewers’ brains for a while. Comparisons to Sofia Coppola’s &lt;em&gt;Virgin Suicides&lt;/em&gt; are both apt and incomplete. Coppola was working from source material that was familiar to her, but this film feels far more grounded in reality and far more political. Ergüven has created a film that indicts society in the starkest of terms. The lives of girls are difficult, and they are made much more difficult because institutions like patriarchy, religion, tradition, sexual policing, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The introduction of uncle Erol’s worst vice, in the third act of the film, is likely to be a divisive one. It didn’t bother me as much, but I can see why some viewers might think its a step too far. In my experience, though, power corrupts in lots of ways, and anger and violence are almost just the tip of the iceberg. I didn’t have a hard time believing that he might go as far as he did in abusing the girls, given what he had done already.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the film is not about him, or even the grandmother for that matter. This film is about the girls. And they are magnificent, one after another. Each actress brought a special mix of emotion, understanding and history to her character. Lale, in particular, made for a great protagonist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mustang&lt;/em&gt; is a great film. It deserves to be seen, promoted and discussed.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Better Living Through Criticism - How to Think about Art, Pleasure, Beauty, and Truth</title>
   <link href="/books/better-living-through-criticism-how-to-think-about-art-pleasure-beauty-and-truth/"/>
   <updated>2016-02-21T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>/books/better-living-through-criticism-how-to-think-about-art-pleasure-beauty-and-truth</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I read this book in one sitting, a couple of hours at the Brooklyn Public Library. Later this month I’ll attend an event there where the author will be in conversation with another one of my favorite critics, Emily Nussbaum. I’ve been excited about this book for a while now, since I heard it was in the making about a year ago while watching a conversation between AO Scott and Ta-nehisi Coates on YouTube. I’ve waited for it with excitement and before its release, I read many reviews and interviews with Scott. Reading critics’ takes on a book about criticism can be a tautological exercise, but as Scott says in his book, criticism is a tautology in itself. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The true joy of this book is in its discourse with the thinkers that came before it. There’s plenty to debate and pick over in terms of definitions, arguments and evidence; like any good work of art the excitement comes from thinking and talking about it after it is over. But while I was reading, that’s not what I found most interesting. I was hooked by Scott’s choices to engage with critics like Pauleen Kael, Susan Sontag, Walter Pater, Harold Bloom, philosophers like Kant, poets like Keats, Shelley, Phillip Larkin and Rilke, painters, authors, artists of all kind. Some of these figures I’m more familiar with than others. But each example or argument taken up by Scott, illustrated through past works, and furthered through his own additions, brought some new perspective. In the end, I ended up with pages of notes, a long reading list and a renewed sense that both art and criticism are hugely important parts of my life (and dare I say, any life fully lived). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another, more self-serving, reason I was so interested in this book is because I too take criticism seriously. For a few years now I’ve written a review of every &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/18143960?shelf=read&quot;&gt;book I read&lt;/a&gt; and every &lt;a href=&quot;http://letterboxd.com/samarthbhaskar/&quot;&gt;film I watch&lt;/a&gt;. I often write long emails to friends about podcasts, TV shows, exhibits at a museum, experience at a concert, a new album, art of all sorts. The central conceit of Scott’s argument, that we’re all critics and “intellectualization” is merely another way of saying “thinking,” is in line with my own philosophy of life. For me this feeling started somewhere in high school, was emboldened in college and has become stronger since. In fact, like Scott, I felt great kinship to both Remy and Ego in &lt;em&gt;Ratatouille&lt;/em&gt;, and think about it often as a beautiful testament to the dual responsibilities of artists and critics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While reading this book, I happened to choose one of Eric Whitacre’s latest albums. The choral works provided a great soundtrack to the scenes in museums, discussion of classical and contemporary philosophers, and the heyday of 20th century cinema. One of the tracks, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AE0YMz-d320&quot;&gt;“Little Lamb,”&lt;/a&gt; has been a favorite for a few months now. I often listen to it on repeat. Despite its simplicity, like much of Whitacre’s compositions, it is full of feeling. I’m not a religious person, in fact I think about religion almost exclusively as an academic or sociological act. I don’t derive much meaning from it. But the lyrics of this song, in the context of appreciating art and criticism hit me in a new way this time. “Little lamb who made thee/dost thou know who made thee” rang through my ears as I found myself feeling thankful for the creation of both man and art.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>The Crying Game</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://letterboxd.com/samarthbhaskar/film/the-crying-game/&quot;&gt;LetterboxD review link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A solid political, romantic, sexual thriller. The Crying Game features great performances by Stephen Rea and Jaye Davidson, and an awful one by Forest Whitaker. The first act featured great dialog between Jodi and Fergus, but the second and third act left me wanting more of the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After reading about the commotion around the twist when the film first released, it seems this film got some of the same treatment that something like The Sixth Sense received. The popular conversation focused on the twist, and that affected people’s ability to judge the film on the whole. With the benefit of coming to this film much later, I strongly feel like the twist is important but not central to the film. There is plenty to like about the script, the acting and the directing. But there’s also something to be disappointed in with the third act and its inability to build upon a solid foundation.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Heat</title>
   <link href="/movies/heat-1995/"/>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://letterboxd.com/samarthbhaskar/film/heat-1995/&quot;&gt;LetterboxD review link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I re-watched &lt;em&gt;Heat&lt;/em&gt; recently, as part of a Michael Mann retrospective at the Brooklyn Academy of Music. Since my last viewing, I’ve come to learn more about and appreciate more of Mann’s eye for design, his interest in post-modernism and his affinity for night time shooting, especially night time LA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In previous viewings, I focused on the mesmerizing action sequences, the loud and in-your-face sound design, the inner lives of the protagonists. This time around, however, I was more interested in the set design, the colors and the depiction of LA, a most American of cities. And in the total and complete focus on masculinity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A little while after seeing the film, though, I can’t help but wonder what all this talent in directing, acting, action sequences, sound design, writing would mean if it were put to use to explore something besides masculinity. What would &lt;em&gt;Heat&lt;/em&gt; look like if the women in it weren’t simply there to serve as plot devices, as juxtapositions to the otherwise masculine identities of the leads. What would all this film-making talent produce if it explored something other than cops and robbers, sanctioned violence, or if it gave equal standing to other characters in this movie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s probably a fools errand, to try and imagine what a movie might be were it not what it is. But there seems to be strong consensus that &lt;em&gt;Heat&lt;/em&gt; is a great film, a consensus with which I agree. And that’s why I can’t help but imagine what other subjects could benefit from such great film making.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>The Insider</title>

   <id>/movies/the-insider</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://letterboxd.com/samarthbhaskar/film/the-insider/&quot;&gt;LetterboxD review link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Who are these people?”
“Ordinary people under extraordinary pressure, Mike. What the hell do you expect? Grace and consistency?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I did for my &lt;a href=&quot;http://letterboxd.com/samarthbhaskar/film/spotlight/&quot;&gt;Spotlight review&lt;/a&gt;, I should state some of my biases at the outset. I care about journalism a lot. I work at the NYTimes, I love &lt;em&gt;Spotlight&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;All the President’s Men&lt;/em&gt;. I think investigative journalism is an incredibly important asset in a democratic society. With all this in mind, it may come as little surprise that I liked &lt;em&gt;The Insider&lt;/em&gt;. Although released in 1999, I saw it for the first time as part of a Michael Mann retrospective at the Brooklyn Academy of Music this month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The story, as explained in the end credits, and confirmed through some minimal reading about the events online after the film, is based on true events, but does not adhere to them entirely. This fact does not draw away from the film. Michael Mann centers this film around Al Pacino, who carries it well, and is a good balance to a neurotic and imperfect Russell Crowe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the complaints I’ve heard about &lt;em&gt;Spotlight&lt;/em&gt;, especially in discussions about its Best Picture chances, is that it was too much of an ensemble piece, without enough of an artistic ethos at its core to be considered a successful film. This is a valid criticism, especially in comparison to “artsier” films like &lt;em&gt;The Revenant&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Mad Max: Fury Road&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;em&gt;The Insider&lt;/em&gt; shows what a docu-drama about journalism can do with an artistic director at the helm. I’m not convinced it does a better job of telling a story, or is more or less convincing as a film, just an interesting juxtaposition to the otherwise matter-of-fact, no-frills directing in &lt;em&gt;Spotlight&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this more stylistic take, Mann also chose to lay on a heavy score during a few emotionally important scenes in this film. That was a choice I could have done without.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Hail, Caesar!</title>
   <link href="/movies/hail-caesar-2016/"/>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://letterboxd.com/samarthbhaskar/film/hail-caesar-2016/&quot;&gt;LetterboxD review link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hail, Caesar!&lt;/em&gt;, like most films by the Coen brothers can be seen in many different modes. Viewers have the choice to take it in as a paean to 1950s Hollywood, as a film about faith systems or a collection of scenes, one funnier and more charismatic than the next, featuring contemporary Hollywood’s most famous stars parodying old Hollywood’s most famous stars. Each of these viewings is valid and has its benefits. I found myself floating in and out of these themes throughout the film. Although they accomplish more in other films (&lt;em&gt;A Serious Man&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;No Country for Old Men&lt;/em&gt; among their best), &lt;em&gt;Caesar&lt;/em&gt; is full of great scenes, interesting themes, laughs, narrative intrigue and strong performances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of the many explorations of faith in this film (and, again, I think &lt;em&gt;A Serious Man&lt;/em&gt; is probably a better exploration of faith by the brothers), I found the discussion of Marxism the most interesting. Without going into too much detail, Marxian philosophy is discussed by a cabal of Hollywood writers using phrases usually reserved for the academy like “the dialectic” and “means of production.” What results is an interesting exploration of the myth making powers of Hollywood. Marx, famous for calling religion the opiate of the masses, was keenly aware of the power of historical narratives. The Coen brothers, similarly, are keenly aware that secular imagery and myth making is a powerful part of American history. They don’t shy away from Hegelian/Kantian thesis-antithesis-synthesis concepts in implicating Hollywood in its own demise, or if not demise, a thorough inspection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Coen’s have made films about America starting from the 1800s, into the 20th century, all the way up to contemporary times. Depicting Hollywood in 1951, at the height of studio power, of central planning, of cohesive American vs. USSR narratives, before TV came in and shook things up, before the internet came in and threw a wrench into our collective American myth making proved a worthwhile story for the film makers to create and for the audience to experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the stuff that struck me, but lest I make the film sound too heady there is also an incredible scene with a rabbi, an Eastern Orthodox priest, a Catholic priest and a Protestant minister that stuck with me just as much as the Marxian stuff. Kudos to the Coen brothers for bringing all manner of pleasure to the screen.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>My Brilliant Friend (The Neapolitan Novels,</title>
   <link href="/books/my-brilliant-friend-the-neapolitan-novels-1/"/>
   <updated>2016-02-07T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>/books/my-brilliant-friend-the-neapolitan-novels-1-</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It’s taken me a few days to write this review after finishing Elana Ferrante’s “My Brilliant Friend.” Even while reading the book I didn’t quite know how to think about it. It’s a book about nothing, in the sense that Seinfeld was a show about nothing or in the sense that Flaubert thought of Madame Bovary as the first novel about nothing. There’s not much new in that idea any more, we’ve come to expect novels to dwell in the daily, the mundane, the seemingly unimportant. Ferrante’s addition to this genre, then, is possibly that she writes from the viewpoint of a young Italian woman. In that aim, she hits her mark. Not many exciting, big or entertaining things happen, but we get to learn a lot about the protagonist, her feelings about her youth, her friends and her environment. This is, again, not new. Another contemporary point of comparison could be Karl Ove Knausgaard’s “My Struggle” series. While Karl Ove writes about the the life of a white Norwegian man, from Ferrante we get something slightly different. I don’t think it’s altogether misguided to compare these two books.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, if this premise is to be accepted, that Ferrante is interested not in telling a story, but in introducing a new type of person into this genre, then the question becomes, is she successful in that attempt? My claim is yes, she’s successful, but not to an impressive degree. I found the scenes, the characters, their violence, their contempt, the decisions they were making and the decisions of those around them less than compelling. At multiple times during the book I was left wondering, why do I care about these characters, besides the fact that I’ve just been reading about them for a while? Lila was fascinating at times, but too distant. I was interested in Elana’s inner life, but wanted more big decisions to come her way so I could learn more about her character.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All of this could be sorely misguided because this is, after all, the 1st in a 4 part series. At this time, I don’t think I’ll continue to see where all this goes, however enticing all the critical and popular acclaim might be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lovely portrait of platonic love. The animation style, with clean lines, sharp edges and muted colors is something I personally take a liking to. Especially in the context of space, snow and a harsh environment, I appreciated the soft, bureaucratic animation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An actor’s delight, and a delight for us to see Harvey Keitel, William Hurt, Forest Whitaker, Harold Perrineau, Stockard Channing, Ashley Judd (who may have outperformed everyone with the least time on screen) take the challenge and run with it. In so far as director’s are partially responsible for an actor’s success, this can be considered a directorial acheivement. But beyond that, the film lacks a powerful script, and a strong artistic drive to be more than a good film with some great performances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My favorite part of this short was the depiction of a late 80s/early 90s immigrant Indian apartment. Barely any furniture, white walls, white blinds, but definitely a TV and definitely a DIY religious shrine. Every picture from my childhood would reflect that setting. I was expecting to fully love “Sanjay’s Super Team,” (one of my friends was on the creative team, I’m the Sanjay in my own life, etc) and I did. It is a great addition to Pixar’s library of short films.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The animation in this short was stunning. My jaw was ajar the whole time. The choice of starting the short out with a live action scene of the process of drawing was a great way to situate this short in the context of largely computer animated shorts in its genre. The short itself carries less of a plot and less weight than most others, but the craftsmanship with which it is made is abundantly present on screen and puts it right next to other nominees. I suppose the fact that it is called “Prologue” clues us in to a longer story of the young girl in the film. But a hint does not a story make.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://letterboxd.com/samarthbhaskar/film/code-unknown/&quot;&gt;LetterboxD review link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Michael Haneke’s &lt;em&gt;Code Unkown&lt;/em&gt;, a title worth remembering while watching the film, is comprised of about 50 loosely connected, but largely unconnected scenes. Each can be described as a long take, with either kinetic movement or terse dialog (rarely combined), each framed with furniture, doorways, street signs, stores or a person framing the view. The acting, especially Juliette Binoche (who is living up to the claim of best living actress in the world in every film I see of hers), at once grounds the film and elevates it. The film is like a collection of short stories, with some tying themes, but more a depiction of a world view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this case, the world view we get from Haneke could be something like this: we interact with each other imperfectly, always unable to truly connect because we’re missing the right words, the right understanding, the exact behavior, the exact code to make the right connection. As a result, our world is full of small and large frictions. We fight with the ones we love (in a grocery store, perhaps). We cry for our children who face a harsh world. We are unable to help the neediest among us (disgusted by a beggar on the street, rather than at the conditions that got her there). We avoid eye-contact and look the other way as someone gets harassed on the subway. These are the frictions Haneke is interested in, and the missing codes he captures so well in this film. Each scene and relationship is pegged around an imperfect understanding of a code: a code to get into a building, a phone code, a code of conduct, a code of honor, a code by which we can conduct society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A devastating short. The whole thing was captured for me in a moment when the bear is ringing a bell above his head to attract passersby on the street to stop, pay him a coin, and watch his story. He has his eyes closed, but a far away look on his face. When we see his face next, he is just as sad, but a little more present. He is made slightly more content knowing that his story touched the small boy who just watched it, and that, helps ease his pain.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://letterboxd.com/samarthbhaskar/film/margin-call/&quot;&gt;LetterboxD review link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Margin Call&lt;/em&gt; is a film about the financial crisis that takes a big risk, focuses only on one night, only on one firm, only on a handful of key players. It hardly mentions the millions of American people who were affected by the actions of these characters. For many this would be a disqualifying choice - how can you make a film about a housing crisis that doesn’t show a single middle-American home owner, a single blue collar job lost, or any of the havoc that these financiers caused. To me, however, this is exactly why this film was successful. JC Chandor chose a small slice of a large and confusing episode in American history, he wrote a story about only a few characters and “dumbed things down” so as to fit the needs of a 2 hour film.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike &lt;em&gt;The Big Short&lt;/em&gt; which made arguably the opposite choices, to focus on a multiple unconnected characters, to depict foreclosed homes, (passingly) show a family who lost their job and home and throw the viewer into many details about the financial crisis, &lt;em&gt;Margin Call&lt;/em&gt; succeeds due to its discipline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Margin Call&lt;/em&gt; is also a great depiction of the prototypical characters who make up the finance industry - a 22 year old junior analyst obsessed with how much everyone makes, a rocket scientists disillusioned with academia, a former engineer who gave up building bridges, management minded ladder climbers, and powerful CEOs and board members charged with maximizing profits at all costs. Each of their attempts at justifying what their industry does (bring liquidity to the market, do the work that regular Americans don’t want to do, make their dreams possible) fall flat. I have spent a lot of time trying to understand this industry and everyone who has attempted to explain its importance to me has failed at convincing me, and I’m afraid, in reality, is not so convinced themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We, as people, are attracted to narratives. And what more attractive story could there be than one that features us in the center. This was the unbecoming of Kumiko, the protagonist in this story. She was keen on being at the center of her own story, at any cost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kumiko: The Treasure Hunter&lt;/em&gt; is partly about our relationship with our own narratives. Where does the truth stop and where does a story begin? Kumiko is a flawed protagonist, we can’t trust her, but because of a fantastic performance by Rinko Kakuchi, I was along for the adventure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using an admittedly fascinating premise - a Japanese woman was found dead in the northern US, far from her home, and an urban legend claimed she was hunting for a treasure she saw in &lt;em&gt;Fargo&lt;/em&gt; - the Zellner brothers set out to explore this narrative/truth relationship also present in the other brothers’ films. Perhaps it was easier for the Zellner brothers, too, to see their story in the Coen Brothers’ story. From this starting point, the story goes to interesting places but the narrative never truly shapes into anything as compelling as the premise. The final act of the film wrestles with ideas about fact vs fiction, reality vs imagination. But we’re left just with explorations, no real answers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both premises: the one about a Japanese woman’s death in America and the idea that we all have stories to tell are attractive. But they are just premises, just a question to ask at the beginning. The real payoff comes from the truth. Do we all, in fact, have stories to tell?&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://letterboxd.com/samarthbhaskar/film/clerks/&quot;&gt;LetterboxD review link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Clerks&lt;/em&gt; is a remarkable debut film. For all the work Kevin Smith has gone on to produce, I can’t think of anything, save for maybe &lt;em&gt;Dogma&lt;/em&gt;, that has the same originality, confidence, strength of voice, verve and joy as this film. Tarantino likes to say about his films, “I know this is a good film, because I would have fun watching it as a play, as a reading, or as a novel.” Writers could benefit from aspiring to this sort of approach to their writing. If a story is good, it should be good in many media. &lt;em&gt;Clerks&lt;/em&gt; strikes me as this type of a story. I could see myself enjoying it as a play, a series of short stories, a serialized TV show or a novel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Smith’s influences, including Jarmusch, Linkletter and Spike Lee are all present in this film but he never seems to be derivative of their work. Even his black&amp;amp;white photography is reminiscent of French new wave directors but never feels like it is ripping it off. Smith is able to turn his camera to a small location (largely filmed in a cramped convenient store and video store), film mostly dialog and little action but make an entertaining, even sometimes heartfelt, film about angst, ambition, friendship and love. It may be one of the better illustrations of the effect of suburban upbringing on a whole generation of Americans too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The film suffers from plenty of flaws, almost all traceable to the fact that this is a first film for a new writer and director. But it hints a great promise, unfortunately largely unfulfilled since debut.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://letterboxd.com/samarthbhaskar/film/top-five/1/&quot;&gt;LetterboxD review link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chris Rock counts Woody Allen among his many inspirations. The work of Woody Allen, the walk-and-talks, scenes around New York, flirtation through conversation, romanticism in argumentation, all of these are present in &lt;em&gt;Top Five&lt;/em&gt;. Rock is never ripping off, he is always paying homage, but making these scenes his own - which is no small accomplishment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What he takes from Allen (also a namesake for Rock’s character in the film), and updates, is his relationship with Rosario Dawson and women in general on screen. Woody Allen seems to respect some women more than others throughout his filmography. Rock, on the other hand (his depictions of strippers notwithstanding) seems much better at treating women as his intellectual and artistic peers. He trusts Rosario Dawson most, but even smaller characters like Leslie Jones, Gabrielle Union, and Sherri Shepherd are treated better than the average woman in a Woody Allen film.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://letterboxd.com/samarthbhaskar/film/the-project-of-the-century/&quot;&gt;LetterboxD review link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I saw Carlos Quintela’s &lt;em&gt;The Project of the Century&lt;/em&gt; at the Museum of the Moving Image, where he was in attendance to participate in a Q&amp;amp;A after the film. I was impressed with how mature, well-spoken and self-assured he seemed for a young director. And after seeing his film, that confidence was also clear in his film-making.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thought about two major things while watching this film: (1) how well it incorporated historical context into a medium that usually has difficulty doing that. And (2) how it borrowed from French New Wave cinema to add to its success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;American culture is really bad at providing historical context where appropriate. In fact, often it seems like we go out of our way to forget history. This is difficult in policy making, in mainstream news, in almost every type of communication but perhaps the most difficult in film because of limits of space and time and expectations of audiences. This film, however, incorporated historical texts and context very well. The interplay between old documentary footage and current fictional footage was edited in a way that both moved the story forward and also gave the audience plenty to think about in terms of the interplay between past and present. That is no small feat, and I applaud the filmmakers for achieving it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other major success of the film was the use of French New Wave aesthetics to situate Cuba’s place in the world in the same way the 50s and 60s French auteurs situated France in the post-war global context. Leo, the youngest of the 3 males in the center of the film, serves as the best example of a French New Wave character. Unlucky in love, lost in his own country, unhappy with his home life, Leo captures the anxieties of the latest generation struggling with identity (their own and their country’s). His father and grandfather, too, for that matter, struggle with identity but in a way that suggests more hopeless nostalgia (to borrow my friend’s phrase) than active angst. The film captured so well the feelings of 40, 50, and 60 year old Cubans who are now dealing with the realities that the promises they heard for the last 50 years are just not true.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After seeing &lt;em&gt;Hateful Eight&lt;/em&gt; I wanted to revisit &lt;em&gt;Inglorious Basterds&lt;/em&gt; to see if the violence in this film felt the same. I’m happy to report it doesn’t. The violence feels much more incorporated in the story, much less nihilistic and self-indulgent. It is used in measure to exercise the feelings and convey what is at stake for these characters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This film also feels a lot more personal, for Tarantino, than &lt;em&gt;Hateful Eight&lt;/em&gt;. “This just might be my masterpiece,” as a final line, the focus on film, cinemas and movies, the silly foot stuff and especially the two long scenes with heightened tension through just dialog; it is clear these are the things Tarantino believes in. And it is clear through how good the final product turns out to be, that his strength of belief matches his talents as a film maker here more than anywhere else in his filmography.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“No Matter how elaborate a system of philosophy you work out, in the end, it’s gotta be incomplete” - Halley Reed (Mia Farrow)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Crimes and Misdemeanors&lt;/em&gt; has much less directorial flash than other Woody Allen films. There’s better cinematography in &lt;em&gt;Manhattan&lt;/em&gt;, better editing and dialog in &lt;em&gt;Annie Hall&lt;/em&gt;, better characters in &lt;em&gt;Hannah and her Sisters&lt;/em&gt;. But where this film succeeds beyond those others, is in a full depiction of Allen’s philosophy of life. Between the philosophy professor on screen in Cliff’s documentary (not too dissimilar from &lt;em&gt;While We’re Young&lt;/em&gt;’s plot point, but much better used as a plot device), a blind rabbi, an ophthalmologist who can’t see himself clearly and a set of film-makers fumbling around with their own incomplete moral compasses, there are so many character ripe with theories about how to live life, what matters, what doesn’t and how to deal with it all. In the end, we the audience get the benefit of all this exploration. It’s not so much that we receive a complete and flawless theory of life, but an exploration of themes and ideas as old as time, packaged in a pseudo-thriller. One without a happy ending, perhaps, but for that we could “go see a Hollywood movie” right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since we don’t get a nicely buttoned philosophy, I suppose what we get is Allen telling us that he doesn’t know the answers but he has spent his life, as a little boy at the family Seder table, a young man in marriage, a professional film-maker, wrestling with big ideas. He doesn’t hide his flaws. He isn’t perfect in marriage, he doesn’t quite understand why sexuality works the way it does (his own and others’), he’s judgmental even behind the camera, but despite all of these flaws, he keeps trying and wrestling to understand life. And there may be no hierarchical framework to fit all of these needs, but the desire to find one is strong with him, and he will continue to search.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Lauren Groff’s “Fates and Furies” is a gift for literary readers. It is full of ambitious writing, features two fascinating protagonists, a cast of interesting and recognizable secondary characters, and reading it feels like her world is washing over you, in turn warm and chilly. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the outset, it is hard to feel engaged with this book. Lotto’s half (“Fates”) of the book is written with lofty, playwright-inspired prose. Sometimes this feels indulgent, sophisticated and overly theatrical. But it is worth sticking through to the second half (Mathilde’s “Furies”) where the prose comes back down to earth, and the character and plot details come with more fireworks. When Mathilde takes center stage, the novel is taken to another level. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In fact, if readers find themselves interested in the sordid details of Mathilde’s past, the struggles she went through to become who she is and the kind of story that comes out of a life like that, Yanagihara’s “A Little Life” may be of interest. It too, is full of difficult, gut-wrenching characters and stories that require nerves of steel from a reader, but pay off in big ways for your interest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ultimately, though, “Fates and Furies” remained too unbalanced for me to consider it a favorite. Spending nearly 200 pages feigning interest in Lotto and then reconciling the sometimes unbelievable things Mathilde goes through in the next 200 pages made for a disjointed experience. There is a lot to love in this book, but also a lot to roll your eyes at.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://letterboxd.com/samarthbhaskar/film/45-years/&quot;&gt;LetterboxD review link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m reading Lauren Groff’s “Fates and Furies” currently and a passage I happened to read today said something like - “…somewhere along the way she had become a wife. And as we all know, wives are invisible.” This hit me like a ton of bricks. Later in the day I saw &lt;em&gt;45 Years&lt;/em&gt; and couldn’t stop thinking how marvelous this film was for turning an otherwise invisible wife, visible. Thanks to superb acting, an even keeled script and a director that smartly stayed out of the way, this film simmered for about 80 minutes, slowly building pressure, only to have one of the most understated but powerful finishes I’ve seen this year. I would hold this ending up against &lt;em&gt;Phoenix&lt;/em&gt; as some of the best pay offs in cinema I saw this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rampling’s performance has received praise and she deserves more. Her ability to carry this film without entirely stealing the show is in tune with the role wives have come to play in modern marriages. The choices this film makes, to focus on her character and take the viewer on her emotional journey is something I’d love to see more of in film. An equivalent film might have rendered the same character invisible or equally as visible as her husband. &lt;em&gt;45 Years&lt;/em&gt; focuses on Jeff, her husband, a few times, but swiftly returns to Kate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been thinking about Haneke’s &lt;em&gt;Amour&lt;/em&gt; since I first saw it in 2012. I haven’t had the courage to see it again because it devastated me on first viewing. Seeing &lt;em&gt;45 Years&lt;/em&gt; reminded me how much I got from that film. I may finally have the steel to go back for another watch. I’m guessing I will feel the same way about this film, thinking about it years from now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve probably watched and read more hours of Slavoj Žižek’s meandering, imprecise, acerbic political philosophy than I care to admit. And though much of it feels repetitive (the same psychoanalytical concepts show up in critiques of film, politics, industry, finance, and so on and so on), I’m always having fun. I suppose that is central to Žižek’s ideology: whatever you do, have fun. And in his case, fun is closer to enjoyment rather than pleasure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Žižek, I’ve learned, is better as a source for questions rather than answers. This becomes clear in this documentary, especially, as he jumps from topic to topic with little connective tissue in between. Most topics and film snippets are interesting. Mostly, however, I was interested in the formulations of his questions about society and how these ideas play out in popular films. There’s still plenty to love about a contemporary public theorist who brings attention to unseen forces at play in our world.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://letterboxd.com/samarthbhaskar/film/the-revenant-2015/&quot;&gt;LetterboxD review link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not exactly sure what it means that films like &lt;em&gt;Mad Max&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Martian&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Revenant&lt;/em&gt; are among some of the most popular films in America this year. But our interest in survivalism, in the context of growing inequality, state sponsored violence and overall waning trust in institutions is noticeable to me. I fear we’re already preparing for the worst of times, without first paying attention to what we might do to fix our current situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first 45 minutes of this film, including the opening battle scene, and the subsequent beginning of a journey for these frontiersman is fantastic. The film moves with kinetic energy, each plot point revealed feels important and well calibrated against a back drop of violence and bloodshed. We are introduced to beautiful landscapes that surround these characters and there’s a clear way to understand why some characters are important and others less so. Over the course of the rest of the film, however, it is only the vistas that remain as deep and interesting. Each character becomes less and less compelling and each plot point moves the story along less and less.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Between &lt;em&gt;The Revenant&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Hateful Eight&lt;/em&gt; there’s a lot of suffering on screen this month. And suffering, in and of itself, is not remarkable. It becomes remarkable when it is contextualized in circumstance, or personality, or something larger. These two movies, however, seemed to revel in suffering for its own sake. They used their plot points (somehow even more of an after thought in &lt;em&gt;The Revenant&lt;/em&gt; than in &lt;em&gt;The Hateful Eight&lt;/em&gt;) only to carry the viewer from one episode of suffering to the next. There were very few times that I felt bought into the characters, their motivations and the context for why they were either going through so much or willing to go through so much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether DiCaprio earns an Oscar for this or not, is not as interesting to me (I’ve already given him Oscars in my head for his work in films like &lt;em&gt;Wolf of Wall Street&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Departed&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Shutter Island&lt;/em&gt;). I’m more interested in the fact that Iñárritu chose to go back to these instincts that were present in &lt;em&gt;Amores Perros&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Biutiful&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Babel&lt;/em&gt; rather than realizing that he received the most positive response for &lt;em&gt;Birdman&lt;/em&gt; and perhaps he should explore a future in that direction instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite a few funny scenes, some dialog about “what type of movie this is,” and a central plot that draws heavily from the spy-movie genre, but updates it to include class warfare anxieties and fancier gadgets, &lt;em&gt;Kingsman: The Secret Service&lt;/em&gt; falls apart in its third act. The writers were interested in upending some traditional rich, white, male centric tropes in this genre. They helped their case by bringing a woman spy into the fold, by focusing the future of this organization on a lower class upstart (however Horatio Algerian the language of “you don’t need a silver spoon” may be) and making some tongue in cheek jokes about the kind of movie they intended to make.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, for every step in a positive direction, the writers chose to make the villain an impish black man (again, Sam Jackson may have done more to sully the image of black men in movies than any other actor acting, stop taking these roles, I implore you), sent the only woman spy in the movie into outer space only to literally phone-it-in during the film’s climax, and had the protagonist claim victory by banging an unknown character at the end. If that’s meant to be a commentary on the genre, like the other stuff, that remains unclear to me. The film also made some frenetic judgments about religious extremists, the poor masses and the ultra elite. Which of these deserved to die the most? Which was the film interested in saving? It’s all pretty unclear to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Memoir is perhaps my favorite genre in literature. Mary Karr, Nabokov, Bill Clegg, Michael Herr, Margo Jefferson are among my favorite writers because of the stories they’ve told about their own lives. Kirsten Johnson has more than earned her place on my list of favorite memoirs. The work she has done for 25 years as a documentary cinematographer, that stories she has witnessed, have become her story. Like Sarah Polley’s &lt;em&gt;Stories We Tell&lt;/em&gt; or even Casey Neistat’s daily vlogging, Johnson’s mastery is the result of her ability to capture moments in her life and then edit them together to create an engrossing story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cameraperson&lt;/em&gt; is, above all, art. It is also memoir. It contains political commentary, comparative and international. It has elements of philosophy. It contains far more critical thought than one might expect from a film created entirely out of b-footage from documentary film making. Editing, again, plays a huge role in its success. To create and advance a narrative, with distinct, but connected thoughts, out of disconnected footage, is an impressive feat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The film ebbs and flows through different shooting experiences that Johnson has had. But a tying thread – footage of her aging, ill, mother, her kids, her family – brings Johnson into focus in a different way. A simple trick, but a meaningful one, Johnson shows throughout the film how she has been shaped by what she has seen and who she has been with.&lt;/p&gt;

   <id>/books/the-spirit-level-why-more-equal-societies-almost-always-do-better</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;There’s been much discussion, mostly centered around politics but traces of this type of thinking could be found elsewhere, about the role of facts in political discussion these days. Examples like “True Enough” by Farhad Manjoo, Colbert’s seminal debut essay on “truthiness” and the constant undermining of facts in public discourse make it very difficult to have a meaningful discussion about any controversial topic. So many of my conversations with friends or family devolve into some form of the following:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	- Me: here’s some evidence about why I believe the point I just made. Here’s the source. It’s not the whole picture, it only reflects a sliver of knowledge I have.&lt;br /&gt;	- Interlocutor: Well I don’t know the motivations of that source, and I have a counterpoint from another source whose worldview matches mine better. My counterpoint probably doesn’t even rightly address the point you just made, is tangential at best, and because we’re both motivated parties in this discussion, there’s no good way for us to evaluate our arguments. So both our arguments are equally as good, or alternatively, equally as bad. &lt;br /&gt;	- Me: Ok, seems we’ve reached an impasse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a very frustrating way to get no where. But I’m also at a loss for how to remedy this sort of thing. How can I evaluate my facts, someone else’s facts, figure out which argument is stronger, which side is right, under a deluge of facts? So far my answer has been to resolve to some relativist position, “we’re both right, if you look at it in different ways,” which feels hollow and inapt to match the high stakes of the kinds of questions we’re talking about - inequality, climate change, housing policy, foreign policy, and so on. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a data scientist, one of my go to aphorisms is: “It takes an order of magnitude more work to debunk bullshit than to create it.” The authors did more than an order of magnitude of work to debunk prevailing attitudes about inequality. The authors, and others, are working very hard to debunk all sorts of bullshit. But the hardest realization for all of us working on difficult questions like these is that just doing the work will not debunk the bullshit. There’s still a chance after you’ve done the work, that bullshit will persist. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This book will likely reify your biases. If you came in believing income inequality matters (like I did) then you will believe that doubly so. If you came in believing that the world works just how its meant to, and that levels of inequality are where market forces have led them, you’re probably not going to be convinced that we need to do something about inequality here and now. There is plenty of damning evidence, but this is not quite a mic-drop argument. The authors even take on their critics right in the text, either pre-empting their counter arguments or engaging with arguments that were presented after publication. But, somehow, I fear very few people’s minds will be changed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Causal links are hard to establish between fuzzy measures like inequality and health, crime, violence, etc, especially without experiments. But a bevy of correlations are hard to ignore too. This was reminiscent, to me, of the smoking causes lung cancer debate. This debate is often taught in statistics as an example of causality established outside the bounds of controlled experiments. No experiments proved that smoking causes lung cancer (it would be unethical to do experiments), but lots and lots of research about the link between the two was enough to convince most public health officials of the causal connection. Similarly, a bunch of scatter plots with lines drawn down the middle, as presented in the first half of this book, do not make for the best evidence. In fact, it is hard to evaluate the statistical veracity of each of these plots without any measures of fit, variance or robustness to consider. But after enough evidence mounted against inequality, it’s hard to ignore the probable implications.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Fortune Smiles features some of the best short stories I’ve ever read. And they’re all in the same book. And they’re all by the same author. Each story in this collection is full of feeling, every character is written as a recognizable person, every character and every plot feel tightly wound up in each other. Not a moment after I finished one was I excited about what new direction Johnson would take me in with the next. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although each story in Johnson’s collection is slightly different, you can feel the same intellect behind them all. After only a few pages, it becomes easy to recognize whether he’s writing about a woman with breast cancer, Korean refugees, a troubled tech support worker or a former Stasi prison officer, that Johnson makes it his mission to fully understand each of his characters. He is never writing in judgment. His ability to empathize with people close and far from him is unparalleled. I don’t remember if I read this somewhere or if this is a thought I’ve come to believe on my own, but a artist’s biggest asset is his or her gift for empathy. An artist’s ability to succeed is strongly and positively correlated with his or her capacity for empathy. Johnson seems to be winning that battle by a mile, among writers writing today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s be clear about one thing: if you hire Greta Gerwig for a movie, you have to get her to dance. It would be such a waste of talent to not capture her dancing as much as possible, so it lasts forever and ever. Annette Bening’s talents are also marvelously on display here, but Billy Crudup and Elle Fanning deserve as much praise as she’s received.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The political, social and cultural aspects of this movie are interesting, and enough to chew on as the plot, characters and action largely follow a meandering path. But my thoughts mostly drifted toward the use of time in the movie. There are a number of interjections, with narration, images from the real world, and near the end, even depictions of the future. The idea that these characters, captured in a moment in time in their lives, but with full pasts and futures created another layer of fascination for me. It added a weight to their story that would not have been present otherwise. And it made me wonder about my own ability to understand my past or know my future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, the movie is not among the most memorable works of memoir. But it’s funny, layered, emotionally complex and culturally interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s a saying I’ve heard about writing and directing in Hollywood. You can’t make a 8 or 9 film from a 5 or 6 script. The upper bound for your film’s success is almost always how good your script is. &lt;em&gt;A Most Violent Year&lt;/em&gt; has a 6 script, 6 directing, 6 editing and about 6 acting. It’s rare for a film to achieve the same amount of success on all fronts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abel, the protagonist played by Oscar Isaac, is trying to be a descent man in indecent times. This premise, and 1980s New York serve as background for a story that never really takes off. JC Chandor’s imagination, this time, was not up to the challenge. This ends up feeling more like Oscar Isaac’s 2-hour audition reel for &lt;em&gt;Show Me A Hero&lt;/em&gt;, more than a deep, engrossing, wise film about where violence starts and ends. Beyond the costume design, lighting and photography, there is little worth admiration in this film.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If &lt;em&gt;Synecdoche, New York&lt;/em&gt; was a big, long, expansive, epic literary work, &lt;em&gt;Anomalisa&lt;/em&gt; is a beautiful short story. I left the theater wanting more. More wisdom from Kaufman. More scenes between Michael Stone and Lisa. More existential observations. But like the protagonist in this film, this may be more a problem for me, than for the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During a scene in the hotel bar, while Michael is reconnecting with a long since forgotten lover, we watch as she reacts, her eyebrows, her cheeks, her face move in such sensitive ways. To accomplish these feats of acting with computer assisted puppets was no small feat. The work of the stop-motion animators elevated Kaufman’s writing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kaufman is happily writing and creating some of the most original work in mainstream Hollywood. He has cache with studios and movie makers to realize his visions, he has acclaim from critics, and he has the attention of a loyal audience who will show up to support his work. It’s a great time to be a film fan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I understand why Kubrick wanted to hide this film, but there’s a lot of great photography in here. And some strong writing too. Many foretelling signs of a great director in the making.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://letterboxd.com/samarthbhaskar/film/paterson/&quot;&gt;LetterboxD review link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I missed &lt;em&gt;Paterson&lt;/em&gt; at the NY Film Festival earlier this year. I saw Jarmusch’s Iggy Pop documentary, and his Q&amp;amp;A with Iggy was fun to witness (Iggy even makes a small appearance in this film). Much like &lt;a href=&quot;http://letterboxd.com/samarthbhaskar/film/gimme-danger/&quot;&gt;Gimme Danger&lt;/a&gt;, which talked a lot about Detroit’s role in the band’s formation, &lt;em&gt;Paterson&lt;/em&gt; is interested in what might be so special about Paterson, NJ that it has produced a handful of American folk heroes. I found that, otherwise minor, plot line sort of interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most important reason, however, to go see this film is to get a sense of the meditative feeling, the calm and contentment that exists deep within its protagonist. Jarmusch has created a character, like Casey Affleck’s Lee in &lt;a href=&quot;http://letterboxd.com/samarthbhaskar/film/manchester-by-the-sea/&quot;&gt;Manchester by the Sea&lt;/a&gt;, who his quiet, contemplative, but instead of being defined by grief, he is defined by generosity of spirit and an artistic soul. I know far more Patersons from my small-town upbringing than I know Lees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By keeping the scale and ambition of this film contained, Jarmusch succeeds in bringing emotional weight to an otherwise small, mundane, climax scene. The final sequence, then, is a wonderful way to wrap up the film.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I should also briefly mention how well Jarmusch captures the art of writing and re-writing. Seeing poems take shape over the course of the film was a rewarding experience in and of itself.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://letterboxd.com/samarthbhaskar/film/white-god/&quot;&gt;LetterboxD review link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to critics and writers I follow here in Letterboxd and other places, this film came to my attention during a year of fascination with European (especially EU) political turmoil. &lt;em&gt;White God&lt;/em&gt;, a film largely about about contemporary Hungarian anxieties about social structure, control, obedience to the state, the influence of immigrants on the country was a good companion to all the political and breaking event news we’ve been reading all year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Lobster&lt;/em&gt;, is another film that approaches some of these topics from a European point of view. However, &lt;em&gt;The Lobster&lt;/em&gt; is far more successful as a piece of film-making. &lt;em&gt;White God&lt;/em&gt;’s mix of high and low art - going from beautiful scenes of dogs watching cartoons and a climactic sequence full of fear and dread, amidst a plot that feels empty and lacking internal motion - keeps it from rising to the level of a film like &lt;em&gt;The Lobster&lt;/em&gt;. None the less, this is an original, timely film worth seeing.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://letterboxd.com/samarthbhaskar/film/the-hateful-eight/&quot;&gt;LetterboxD review link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two big things kept me from loving this film: (1) Tarantino’s discussion of race, capitalism, north vs south, justice, America’s moral character is short, unsatisfying and doesn’t feel tied to the characters themselves. (2) Daisy is nothing more than a punching bag. The character is redeemed only slightly by Jennifer Jason Leigh’s superb acting (she is downright scary), but she is the recipient of so much violence that never feels earned or justified. Her demise is brutal, almost pornographic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My experience was also tinged by the crowd in the theater, and I imagine this crowd was typical of crowds around the country. One man in particular kept yelling “bitch” every time Leigh was on screen, there was laughter every time she was brutalized. Certainly every theater goer comes in with his/her own history, biases, prejudices, but to have a world view that legitimizes sexual violence and violence against women on screen by a putative cinematic auteur and Hollywood A-lister recently lauded for getting involved in social issues – that doesn’t sit right with me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I enjoyed the acting, the cinematography, the experience of a roadshow, the beautiful Moriconne score (almost like a cover of a best-of Ennio Moriconne scores), even some of the long narrative diatribes in the first act. I was crossing my fingers that Sam Jackson would, for once in his career, not devolve to an angry black man, doing his part to set back American views of black men over and over again. I was disappointed that his character started in one place and ended somewhere completely different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately this all seemed to serve no end other than gore, blood, violence, mayhem. If this is the nihilistic view of America Tarantino has to offer, I’m not interested. Alternatively, if this is Tarantino’s way of getting into the guts of American hate and taking us down with him, he seemed to do nothing more than splash around giddily, rather than actually explore or understand anything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clouds of Sils Maria is a layered film. And each layer is well calibrated to the next. This interplay between the film we’re watching as an audience, the play the actors are preparing for, their conversations about their lives (as characters) and as actors (in a play) serving as commentary about acting (in the real world), all work well together to create tension and keep the audience’s attention. Assayas pulled off a high-wire act in directing this script, for which he deserves praise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the real praise goes to Binoche, Stewart and Grace-Moretz who all turned in fantastic performances. A film about acting requires a lot from its actors, and the main protagonists here did not dissapoint.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://letterboxd.com/samarthbhaskar/film/manhattan/&quot;&gt;LetterboxD review link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I revisited this film after a conversation with some friends about how I find it difficult to distance myself from Woody Allen’s work because I enjoy it so much but I am conflicted about details of his personal life. This is an often discussed topic these days. From news about Bill Cosby, to R.Kelly, Roman Polanski, Woody Allen, it is hard to avoid the implicit choice I might be making in watching and enjoying the work of these artists. In the case of Cosby and Kelly, the 10s of women, the preponderance of evidence, make it easy to avoid their work and feel no remorse about it. Polanski and Allen are harder for me to reconcile. The fact that I have just drawn a line where black men are on one side and white men on the other, is also not lost on me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was in this context that I decided to re-watch MANHATTAN, possibly Allen’s most personal film and one that puts this issue front and center. His relationship with Tracy is centrally featured in this film, and even in the time he spends with Mary, Tracy is somewhere on our minds. Because ultimately this movie is a quintessential American film, filled with anxiety about the past and future. Isaac (and us along with him) have a deep fear of missing out. Every character in this movie is anxious about what they may be missing out on. There’s a disquiet in them all that perfectly reflects dating in New York (the same now as it was in the 70s, it seems), grabbing for status, unending ambition and all the things that are assigned to millennials now, but could be assigned to any set of Americans at any post-war time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it was while thinking all these things (and enjoying the beautiful film making, superb acting, deft directing) that I realized MANHATTAN, and Allen’s work at large, isn’t about his relationships with younger women. He dared us to focus on his relationship as a 42 year old with a high schooler, but instead pulled a magic trick while we were watching.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The central issue: can I enjoy an artist’s work without implicitly condoning his/her bad behavior as a person, is still unsettled for me. I came to find the answer in this film, but it wasn’t there. Instead, there’s a beautiful story about love, loss, anxiety and being young in America.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adam McKay made some bold choices in directing this film. He took complex, heavy, convoluted material and framed it in faux-doc style, with lots of jump cuts, flashbacks, stills and basically every technique you could throw onto the screen. If this technique was meant to invoke the building blocks of a synthetic financial instrument (like a CDO or SCDO), the risk did not pay off. Instead of a screen adaptation like Moneyball, which took similar complex, insider baseball source material, but brought it to the screen in an interesting way, we get a busy, bloated, over-wrought adaptation that succeeds only because of its flashy actors and the gravity of the topic on which it is based.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There have been better screen adaptations of the story of the 2008 crisis, including but not limited to MARGIN CALL and INSIDE JOB (for the didactic) and WOLF OF WALL STREET (for the moralistic). My guess is the THE BIG SHORT will not be as memorable as the others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To wit, the 2008 financial crisis was a once-in-a-generation, world-view forming type of event for people in my peer group. Along with 9/11, which turned people’s attention foreign policy, the financial crisis turned people’s heads toward economic policy. I have been engrossed in reading and learning about economic theory since (in fact my favorite cameo was behavioral economist Richard Thaler). But it frightens me that we depend on entertaining news programs or scintillating journalism to pay attention to otherwise ignored areas of our lives. If Michael Lewis hadn’t spent time researching and revealing this story, we may never have understood the role of the housing market in the financial crisis. To go from fraudulent home loans in Miami to 5M jobs lost requires a non-trivial understanding of complex systems. This American Life’s Adam Davidsen, Malcolm Gladwell, ProPublica, even entertainers like Lin-Manuel Miranda are doing important work in writing and creating entertaining work based on often overlooked social forces. In that way, Adam McKay should be praised for throwing his weight behind this story. I just wish this wasn’t the only way for us to know about how our own society works. It is too easy for interested parties to hide unpalatable details behind boring acronyms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;THE BIG SHORT is fun, it’s funny, it is worth seeing. But as a film, it doesn’t succeed as much as its source material. I wish it did. Our future could depend on work like this succeeding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sean Baker, who also created Starlet a couple of years ago, is perhaps quietly making some of the best films about sex work in our generation. His choice to make this film with saturated colors, around LA neighborhoods not frequently featured in film, matches very well the lives of his characters. The blues, reds and oranges picked up by the iPhone anamorphic lenses are reminiscent of cheap make up that trans sex workers wear themselves. Frantic editing, hand-held jitters, and the constant momentum of a strutting camera mirrors the locomotive spirit within Sin Dee. She can’t be stopped. She is unbelievably resilient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Baker, whether due to the constrains of independent film making or due to self-imposed discipline, is great at keeping his focus on just a couple of things. He doesn’t fill his films with too many characters, too many plot details, too many stories. All of us could learn to do less. But do those fewer things better.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;HALF OF A YELLOW SUN betrays Adichie as a younger writer, than the Adichie who wrote AMERICANAH. That may seem like an obvious statement, but what I mean is that Adichie relies more on narrative and literary structures a lot more in YELLOW SUN than in AMERICANAH. In the latter book, Adichie is much more confident in letting her true talents - painting full, familiar, fascinating characters - rather than focusing on revealing plot points. She’s able to show much more through her characters, rather than telling a specific story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HALF OF A YELLOW SUN is most successful in its first 100 pages. This is where Adichie is introducing the main characters of the novel, showing their day-to-day interactions and creating a tablet upon which the rest of the slightly more heavily plotted story will play out. Once the action kicks in, Adichie is still quite successful, but we lose the real pleasures of just sitting with the characters, rather than running around with them as the Biafran war unfolds. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lest I come off as sounding unimpressed with this book, I should clarify that this is a huge and unequivocal success as a post-colonial literary novel. Adichie is squarely in the tradition of her predecessors like Said, Achebe, Rushdie and others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A brave, brave film. Huppert is incredible. I can’t imagine what it would’ve been like for Breillat to write, direct and create this film out of such a difficult experience.

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://letterboxd.com/samarthbhaskar/film/chi-raq/&quot;&gt;LetterboxD review link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CHIRAQ defies a simple good/bad review. It even defies a see it or skip it recommendation. If you follow the gun debate in the US, if you know about Chicago’s violent crime epidemic, if you’ve heard of Englewood, you’re probably not its target audience. This film, as my best guess, is intended to introduce a new audience to the lives of the South Side (and by extension Baltimore, DC, Brooklyn, Compton, and so on). At times it goes too far by imagining the streets of a neighborhood caked in the blood of slain children. Other times it shows a funeral proceeding in a large black church, where a saint-like white preacher gives an impassioned, informed, deeply effective speech. It tries mightily to toe the line between realism, satire, comedy and social commentary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it does this all while interspersing scenes of comedy, sex and music. Lee’s choice to make this a satirical social commentary makes it difficult as a viewer to really get a grasp around what is art and what is social commentary. Should we give him some leeway (pun intended) in his imperfect depiction of gang members, or grieving mothers, or shots heard on a street during an afternoon conversation, or a shootout in a Wicker Park club? If there’s artistic freedom needed there, what about when he veers into areas where he introduces the history of public housing, joblessness and lack of public resources in the South Side? That mix succeeds sometimes, and it fails at other times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My hope is that audiences see and talk critically about the sexual politics of the movie (about which there is much to say), but ultimately focus on the gun and violence issues. CHIRAQ succeeds almost equally in its discussion of violence and gun control as it fails in its ability to treat men and women fairly, as sexual citizens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In many ways, CHIRAQ is a direct result of the person Spike Lee is. It is brash, outspoken, knowledgable, funny, eye-roll-worthy, shake-my-head-worthy, but says things we need to hear. In 1989, Lee made DO THE RIGHT THING, a film which remains current despite its age. CHIRAQ is its worthy, but lesser, companion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CREED, the 7th film in the Rocky franchise, requires minimal knowledge about its predecessors to enjoy the film on its own merit. The film primarily succeeds on the back of strong writing and director-actor chemistry between Coogler, Jordan, Stallone and Thompson. CREED relies much less than Rocky 1-6 on Philadelphia, on boxing tropes, on over-dramatization through music or violence. To be sure, it uses all of these things for effect, but uses them sparingly. And in its sparing use, is much more successful, not least because the boxing scenes are beautifully choreographed and filmed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The real success, to me, is the role of race in this film. Adonis is a black man, from a mixed background including a privileged life in a mansion. His main opponent is a white man from the working class (although he’s from England, perhaps because burdening the audience with the legacy of white America may have been too much to ask). This subversion was pulled off simply and without being heavy handed. Many aspects of this film react to and are in conversation with Hollywood boxing films, but they hardly seem dogmatic. Instead, they come together to create a new kind of story. We get a full and empathetic portrayal of a black man, who is given emotional complexity but not robbed of his physical dominance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much like the candidate himself, “Sweet Micky for President” shines because of its bombastic, vibrant, entertaining nature. But also like the candidate, it fails to deliver on substance. This is much less a documentary about politics, the effect of the 2010 earthquake or the role of Haiti in the world, and much more a reality-TV style look behind the scenes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pras Michel was in attendance at the screening I went to on a quiet Tuesday night. His role in this whole thing, including why he was watching it with 10 others in NYC on a Tuesday, remain open questions for me.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://letterboxd.com/samarthbhaskar/film/wild/&quot;&gt;LetterboxD review link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was surprised that Nick Hornby, an otherwise excellent screenwriter, was less effective at adapting this source material for the screen. To me, WILD, seemed like a clear example of the same story succeeding as a book, but faltering as a movie. With this as the page from which Vallée was directing, he had only a few places to go. Smartly, he chose to focus on the natural surroundings as the source of visual energy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reese Witherspoon, also given little to work with, was more successful than her colleague screenwriter and director. Her prickly, measured portrayal of Cheryl Strayed was what the character and the film required. Strayed has a lot of wisdom and grace to share on the page, but at this age in her life, she was still figuring things out. Witherspoon was right to portray Strayed at 26 when she was hiking, rather than 39 when she wrote the book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Strayed’s journey, her book, Witherspoon’s development and production of this film, and the success it had upon release are important milestones in the history of feminism in film. It is unfortunate that Hornby and Vallée couldn’t do more for this film.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CAROL succeeds in large because of two main components: Todd Haynes’ directing and bravura performances by Cate Blanchett and Rooney Mara. Haynes is excellent in setting up interiors (little of the movie, like the characters’ lives, takes place outside). He is excellent at using every part of the frame, every corner, every shadow, every reflection. At times he stretches this work far, but it only works to remind you that he’s been watching every part of the frame all along.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blanchett is making herself one of the premier actresses of this generation. It would be easy to confuse a side-by-side portrait of Carol from this film and Jasmine from BLUE JASMINE as the same glamorous, tall, blonde, urbane character. Blanchett, instead, paints a completely new portrait on a similar canvas. I’d love to see her take on a rougher character, to see what she does with it, maybe something like Charlize Theron in NORTH COUNTRY. Rooney Mara also excels in building a whole life into a character who is given very little of a back story. Both carry this film.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The curiosity of gender is also not lost in this film. Two women are more easily invisible in public than two men in the same circumstance might be. There were times Carol would touch Therese or Abby in public, just enough to let the other know she was thinking of her, but not enough to raise any suspicion from others. Or the fact that two women could travel the country, rent hotel rooms together, and largely go under the view of judgmental Midwestern eyes, was well depicted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Masculinity, at least mid-century American masculinity, might not even grant these small freedoms. I’m reminded of masculinity in India, which has different borders. Borders that allow two men to hold hands without violating any part of their heterosexuality. Perhaps this masculinity would fit more with the world as Carol and Therese lived it, but certainly not for someone like Harge in his time. This is not meant as a “meninist” point, but merely a point about the fluidity of gender, even when it seems so imprisoned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of the reviews I’ve read for this film find nothing redeeming about it. While it is a deeply flawed project, in many ways, I find some of the root ideas interesting. A broken marriage, two broken people, not monsters, but full of faults. Celebrities with commodified bodies, subjects of a voyeuristic society, seduced by voyeurism themselves. Even perfection isn’t what it seems. The south of France is played by Malta. There’s enough to think about for the length of the film.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps this should’ve been written and made as a short film, instead of a feature length project. Sometimes a short story is a better home for an idea than a novel.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://letterboxd.com/samarthbhaskar/film/brooklyn/&quot;&gt;LetterboxD review link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BROOKLYN is a simple film, but full of feeling. Many films, when adapted from novels, lose their ability to fill their characters with an inner life. A novel allows for exposition of what’s going on inside, while a film has fewer tools in this respect. This is when a director and writer must rely on an actor to get that inner life across. An actress like Saoirse Ronan is a filmmaker’s best hope for this task. Without her acting, and without John Crowley’s use of every part of the frame to fill the screen with color and warmth, this would be a much lesser film. But because of this, BROOKLYN rises beyond a simple adapted script with few major plot turns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is plenty missing in this film, namely the role of institutions in Eilis’s life. What of sexism, or patriarchy, of the downward pressure the Church may have put in her life in the 1950s. At every turn, institutions in her life come to her rescue, which, for a Irish woman at that time, was likely not the case. But that’s not what this film is about, and not every film needs to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a strange thing to feel close to a Irish migrant making a life for herself in Brooklyn half a century ago. But as a recent transplant myself, I felt a kinship with her. That’s what good story telling can do. It can make you see yourself in the unlikeliest of places.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Writing a book about boredom is a difficult task to assign yourself. But DFW didn’t shy away from difficult tasks. Who knows what the book would’ve turned out to be if he had had time to edit, rethink and reshape parts of it, but as it is now, it has some bright moments but is mostly full of sad, difficult to get through narrative. To me, the brightest moments come in two long conversations. One between a man and a woman and another between three men, all members of the IRS center that is the focus of this novel. In each conversation, Wallace explores deep ideas about personal relationships, past trauma, the role of institutions in society, and a few other engaging topics. Wallace champions the ability to concentrate as the one true antidote to boredom, but it could be said that deep, meaningful conversation with other people is another powerful antidote. To my mind, some of my favorite memories and highest growth moments have been during boring conversations with friends, when our guards are down, when thoughts flow in and out freely and when we’re both open to new ideas and changing our minds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As with many writers of this generation, and this genre, women are either wholly missing or woefully under-represented in this book. A few statistics I looked up suggested IRS workers, especially those in clerical positions, tend to be women. Or even women from minority communities. But most of the characters in this book looked like DFW.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The content of this book recreated its subject, boredom, very well. It’s an accomplishment to capture what is usually an internal dialog, that sounds different in each person’s head, into a book that sounds like it could be in anyone’s head. Then to place that in the context of modern day America, peg it to a notoriously boring and tedious institution like the IRS and still to come out of it revealing some universal truths is worthy of praise. But I’m afraid the praise must be limited, just as the value of boredom is limited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before starting this favorable review, I should admit some biases. I care deeply about journalism. I work at the New York Times. I was taken with films like ALL THE PRESIDENTS MEN, GOOD NIGHT AND GOOD LUCK and FROST/NIXON when I saw them. I also rank Tom McCarthy’s STATION AGENT and THE VISITOR among my favorite all time films. So in some ways, you could say there was a high chance of me liking this film going in. But a similar argument could be made that I had high, and therefore easily dashable, expectations. But I saw TRUTH last weekend, and despite having a similar subject matter, that film did not live up to expectations at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SPOTLIGHT, on the other hand, dove right into the details of a fascinating story and didn’t come up from that basement until the story was finished. In fact, SPOTLIGHT could be described as an act of journalism itself. McCarthy and the filmmakers dove into the past, recreated an important story and told it to a new audience with vigor. The clothing, the cars, the billboards may seem dated but the story is fresh and important as ever. And lest I make it sound too didactic a film, the quality of writing, strong performances (especially Mark Ruffalo who between this and FOXCATCHER has turned in some great work), and a locomotive script kept me engaged the whole time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To me, however, the most compelling feature of the film was its treatment of the institution of journalism as a vital organ of a society full of competing and cooperating institutions. The film hardly ever got bogged down in individual personalities. For a film about pedophilia, there was remarkably little moral indignation. And that, in my opinion, is a strength. Like Marty Baron, the film was interested in the system, not the individual. And in a society of complex, interacting systems, journalism is a critical institution. It may not serve to tell you the weather or when movies are playing any more, but it must survive to tell you stories about your community that others don’t want you to know. Let’s just hope we don’t look back and wonder how we didn’t see some of these things coming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m a resident of Brooklyn. I live next to Fort Greene, where this movie takes place. I have many feelings about Brooklyn that are echoed in the first 3/4 of this film. Many features of my life are presented for me to point at, bask in, and smile to myself about in this movie. In fact, I probably would’ve watched the first 3/4 of the film, come home and have written a nice, pleasant review. There’s nothing wrong in basking in a film like “Obvious Child,”  or a show like “Girls” for mirroring back to you all the things you like about your neighborhood and way of life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given how I was feeling before the final act of this film, I should be feeling manipulated or duped by writer director Sebastian Silva. But I don’t feel that way. I’m impressed with how easily Silva got me so comfortable with my world he was painting for me, and then how swiftly he pulled the rug from under my feet. The final act of this film is a great rebuke to the self-congratulatory, leisure focused, new bourgeois lifestyles of Brooklynites, myself included. Add some beautiful Fort Greene cinematography, lovable protagonists, soft humor and this makes for a good watch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not giving a shit about what audiences think about your art really frees you up to do some bold things.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I got a chance to see Bill Clegg speak about this novel before I read it. During his talk he mentioned the way he wrote this book. Over the course of 7 years, Clegg took small breaks from his day job as a literary agent to head upstate and write the novel in a series of chapters that came to him about each character. Whenever he felt bored or like the voice of a character wasn’t resonating, he’d stop writing about that character and pick up on another. This method becomes clear while reading this novel. Each chapter introduces or advances the story of a single character. Very little ink is devoted to interactions between characters, to the point that spoken dialog is italicized. The majority of this book unfolds the story by walking us through the inner lives of these characters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite some frustrations about not caring about non-primary characters and a slow-to-unfold plot, Clegg delivers a beautiful, heartrending story about grief. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While reading the book, it wasn’t clear to me why this novel was shortlisted for the Booker prize, or in the conversation for National Book Awards. But upon finishing, it became clear that Clegg used the entirety of the book to get his message across. I’m glad I stuck with the book, and upon finishing, very much agree that it should be in conversation for one of the best books of the year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m highly interested in the subject matter of this film - journalism, its importance to democracy, the Bush administration, the elections of 2000 and 2004, and the role new media has played in dismantling traditional media structures. And yet, I spent more time breathing out heavy sighs and rolling my eyes because of how heavy handed this film was in its writing, dialog and direction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One guess I have for this, is the possibility that James Vanderbilt, who wrote Zodiac (arguably David Fincher’s best film) is a much better writer than a director. In Truth, he wears both hats, and clearly has a hard time understanding what differences exist between writing (where details must be told) and directing (where details must be shown). Some writers are good at telling. Some directors are good at writing. It is very difficult to achieve success in both.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A great example of what independent cinema can do - take a simple story, a couple of characters drawn with feeling, all placed in a realistic environment, and tell that story without too many distractions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is perhaps the story of the porn industry that PT Anderson would tell if he were making Boogie Nights today, instead of in the 1990s.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Franzen, it seems, feels the need to write long. His recent books have been in the 500-page range. An argument could be made that he feels the need to create an atmosphere around the reader in which he can convey the story he wants to convey. If you list out the facts and events of this novel, they don’t exceed a few pages. I suppose that’s the difference between what Franzen is trying to do and what Hemingway or Akhil Sharma try to do. Franzen wants to write more about how this story feels, rather than just strictly what the story is. It helps, then, that his writing is so good. In most other scenarios, if you asked me to read many pages about an old guy having a frustrating argument with an imagined turd, I probably wouldn’t sign on. But by the end, it is through Franzen’s writing that I end up caring about this character and feeling something about him in the final pages. As Michi Kakutani’s 2001 review states, “clearly Mr. Franzen’s novel would have benefited enormously from a strict editing job,” one can’t help but feel the overlong writing is a tool Franzen could do without. But a shorter Franzen book, just wouldn’t be the same, would it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is also important to keep this book in context of Franzen’s beginnings as a writer. His influences, the white male writers of the 60s, 70s and 80s, his ambitions to write sharp social commentary, and his later-in-life embrace of the fact that he is, first and foremost, a talented writer. That he finally embraces this by the time of writing The Corrections is a boon to us, his readers. And unlike some of his subsequent work, Franzen rightly chose a topic about which he knew a lot and had a lot to say: the American family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More than anything else, my affection for this book is grounded in the fact that it accomplishes what I hope some day to accomplish myself. It tells the story of a family in all its deep, colorful, honest, broken, angry, committed, reality. Families are a peculiar institution. No other institution in our life commands such commitment. Franzen stretches this conceit to far reaches and as a result we get a rich story that often reflects families we know, maybe even our own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Victoria is a difficult film to watch. It is tiring emotionally but also physically. All the hand-held camera work is difficult on the eyes for 2 and a half hours. The beginning of this film sets that tone immediately. The film maker does give a few, needed, breaks primarily through overlaid music. Those are some of the film’s best moments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Undoubtedly, the film’s two biggest accomplishments are its technical accomplishment - one continuous take, 2.5+ hours, 22 locations, one night and performances from its main cast, especially Laia Costa in the lead role. Costa had me rapt throughout the film. By the end I could hardly believe she was the same character we were first introduced to. Her ability to summarize entire scenes worth of emotions in one facial expression was incredible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The film doesn’t ask much from the audience intellectually. There are few if any major social or narrative themes. But it is a ride. And a cinematic spectacle that doesn’t just start and end with its gimmicky conceit.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;North Korea is often mocked but rarely explored with empathy. This book is brimming with empathy. After reading this book, I listened to a few interviews with the author, and this sense of empathy is clear from his first word. Adam Johnson’s primary goal in writing fiction is to build understanding between the reader and his characters. He accomplishes this goal in spades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although this book is constantly moving, covering a lot of ground, changing perspective, full of a sense of impending action, Johnson fills the pages with a lot of wisdom. He sets his ideas on a few major ideas: what is the state’s role in the family? What is the role of fiction-making and propaganda, especially when there’s a strong, shared, collective fiction guiding a whole nation? Johnson’s biggest success is that he never gets too expansive, his scope is pretty squarely focused on a few ideas, but in the end, as with any good literature, by focusing on something specific you end up learning universal lessons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bridge of Spies is undeniably a feat of accomplishment. Fitting in neatly in Spielberg’s filmography next to Munich, Schindler’s List and Lincoln, Bridge of Spies can lay claim to being among one of the best writer/director collaborations in contemporary Hollywood. The script benefited from a Coen Brothers re-write, with interjections of humor, some elevated intellectual writing (like all the dualities featured throughout the film, juxtapositions all in service of the US v USSR construct), and also some of the tripartite constructs (“1, 1, 1”). To my mind, though, the highlight of the film was supporting role played by Mark Rylance. His portrayal of Rudolf Abel set the tone of the film right from the get go and added a sense of gravity every time he was on screen (with the possible exception of the last line of the film, ugh).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My biggest complaint, with the film, and something that deflated the whole experience for me was the final act. Spielberg spent the whole film setting up important questions about justice, moral superiority, national identities, the tough balance between national security and constitutional rights, all of these difficult questions that America has had to face in the last century, and continues to face today. After all this, the ending gives us a jingoistic, “America is better than everyone else,” hyper-sentimental conclusion. It wasn’t the conclusion the film earned, and it wasn’t the conclusion that resonates with me.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Odd Woman and the City takes its name from a couple of pieces of literature that meant a lot to the author. George Gissing’s Odd Women resonated a lot with Gornick in her youth. It was one of the first times she saw in literature people who looked, sounded and felt like her. I imagine some of Gornick’s contemporary readers, especially urban dwellers like me, will feel this way about her addition to the literary landscape in this book.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The writing is inspired, full of feeling, but not sharp. I don’t think sharpness was one of Gornick’s goals. She sets out in this memoir to paint a more impressionistic vision of her life in New York. And in so doing, she ends up describing the life of many single, urban, creative people in this city. The book is full of beautiful, meditative thoughts on friendship, intimate relationships, loneliness and solitude. As someone building a life for myself, alone, in New York, I gained a lot from reading about Gornick’s life.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I’ve been reading some of James Baldwin’s fiction and nonfiction in recent years. I’ve had a hard time consuming it critically. His influence on current cultural writers I admire, his contributions to critical theory, even his difficult prose; these all contribute to fan-boy level admiration from me. I don’t think Baldwin would’ve taken kindly to this. Baldwin was a radical. Radicals are skeptical of mainstream success. Whether he would’ve liked it or not, Baldwin is achieving new heights of mainstream success posthumously. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With this in mind, I walked into The Devil Finds Work tepidly. I love films. I love reading and writing film criticism. Films, for me, are the most comfortable works of art (especially pop art) to engage with. This book is much less about movie reviews than about cultural theory. It may be more useful to think of this book as a using movies as a jumping off point to social commentary. That’s what any good art criticism should be. And as an exercise in criticism, there’s a lot to learn from Baldwin here. The specific works in this book, I was less familiar with, with the exception of some very popular films from this time. But the themes were timeless. America is still grappling with many of these problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best thing I learned from this book, though, was that cultural criticism is best when it squarely places the critic in relation to the art. Critics who aspire to some level of academic distance from the piece of art they’re dealing with end up doing a disservice to the art, the reader, and themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://letterboxd.com/samarthbhaskar/film/taxi-2015/&quot;&gt;LetterboxD review link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Somewhat like Steve Jobs, my interest was first piqued about Taxi when I heard Jafar Panahi was back making a new film in Iran and the main conceit was that he’d imitate a taxi driver and capture life in Iran as it played out on a routine day. That’s a great elevator pitch. However, after this initial similarity, the two projects diverge completely. Panahi proceeds in this film to take you through vignettes of every day life in Tehran in a stripped down, real cinema style, including some jarring highs and lows. By the end, I was along for the ride of wherever Panahi wanted to go next.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much like what Wild Tales did last year for contemporary Argentinian society, Taxi gives us a glimpse into life in Iran today. A few years ago I lived in Dubai with a roommate from Tehran. He was a big film and tv fan like me, so we bonded over movies. His descriptions of how easy it was for bootlegged DVDs to make their way around Tehran, how he could get his hands on all the latest films and tv were well reflected in Taxi. While watching Panahi depict this bootlegging on screen, and keeping in mind that Panahi himself is officially forbidden from making and distributing films, I wondered how much of all this the Iranian regime knows about and let’s happen. As with most authoritarian regimes, there seems to be a level of mutual suspension of disbelief that both members of society and members of the government partake in. After a while reality becomes reinforced by the complicity of the actors. This point was not lost on Panahi, and it can be felt throughout this film.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first act of this film is a masterful piece of screen writing. In fact, when I heard about the conceit for this script last year I was already excited. Sorkin took the germ of his idea, 3 45 minute behind the scenes sequences of Steve Jobs before seminal product launches, and turned it into an impressive script. Immediately in the first act, all the familiar Sorkin tools are apparent: the walk and talks, heavy interpersonal drama brought out through dialog, grand themes explored through minutiae. Sorkin tosses all these balls into the air at once and juggles them beautifully. The second and third act don’t deliver as much on their promise, but still, the writing is impressive as ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You could argue that this film is the antithesis of The Martian. Hardly any problems are solved. It’s all about introspection. And there are many more religious and spiritual overtones rather than pragmatic, scientific problem solving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Steve Jobs, somewhat like Selma, chose to eschew the usual conscripts of a cradle-to-grave biopic, instead showing a man’s life through one or a few important moments in his life. With the exception of Spike Lee’s Malcolm X, I’m strongly starting to favor this choice rather than the usual biopic. However, unlike Selma, which elected to showcase MLK’s experience near the apex of his political and national life, Steve Jobs chose 3 major events in Jobs’ life before he really became an unquestionable national success. Apple and Jobs were not nearly the undisputed kings of consumer tech they are today. In fact, until the launch of the iPhone in 2007, Apple’s marketshare was not nearly as great as it is today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite all of these successes - in addition to the score, the choice in film formats by Danny Boyle, the fact that Danny Boyle largely stayed out of the way of this film (unlike Fincher who inserted himself squarely into Social Network but arguably produced a better film), the acting by the main cast - one thing kept nagging me throughout. Aaron Sorkin has a very particular conceptualization of masculinity and there is no room for much else in his world. Johanna Hoffman, a marketing executive, is basically rendered a glorified personal assistant in this film. Steve Wozniak, a man famous for his gregarious, giving, genial qualities, is deflated into Steve’s “little buddy,” given no teeth in any of their arguments. Even the woman for whom Sorkin seems to have the most affection, Jobs’ daughter Lisa, is only ever seen through paternalistic eyes. For all the criticism that’s leveled against Jonathan Franzen for having a strong male white gaze, Sorkin should receive as much if not more criticism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Somehow this project felt very personal to PTA, I’m not sure why, but I gathered the feeling while watching it. Even though it was short, breezy, something about it felt like it meant something to him. Perhaps because he’s getting older and seeing artists in another part of the world practice their art inspired him, perhaps for another reason entirely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been a fan of Sufi/qawwali music for a long time. It’s incredible for a country so ardently anti-Muslim on its face, how much Muslim art shows up with national resonance in India. Artists like Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan have had national and international success for decades. I still don’t know how Indians square these parts of their identity. How can a country be madly in love with an actor named Shah Rukh-Khan for decades while letting mass murders of Muslims happen in its most populous states. But none of the historical or transnational context was part of this film, nor should it be. It was just something I found myself thinking about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PTA did nothing but play around with cameras and show his technical talent in this film. Which is enough when you’re PTA. The man knows his way around cameras. And now drones too. Musically, this was a great collaboration between Greenwood, Shye Ben Tzur and the Junun band. I’m glad Greenwood and Ben Tzur didn’t try to over-shadow, over-produce or change too much of what makes Rajasthani music unique. This wasn’t so much Jonny Greenwood + Shye Ben Tzur featuring Junun, it was more Junun inviting some international musicians to collaborate with them, to introduce their centuries earned talents to a new audience. And in that it was successful.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;How an economics journalist builds such a gift for prose is beyond me, but I won’t question it, I’m just thankful Jonathan Weisman wrote this book. On its face, there’s very little that’s exciting or compelling about an unrealized American study abroad student and a rich English family, but over the course of this book they’re drawn out in complete colors. We become much more interested in them over time. The slight of hand Weisman plays by starting the book out through David’s eyes but then switching perspective for the majority of the book to Elizabeth’s experience in Africa pays off beautifully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The writing, arguably the best part of the book, isn’t raw, exactly. In fact, it is very much in control. Weisman resembles more a talented race car driver behind the wheel of a powerful car rather than a teenager driving a car careening out of control. I don’t mean to insinuate, however, that Weisman is lacking feeling. In fact this book of full of feeling. The writing here feels like what the inner monologue of an introvert with a vibrant inner life may sound like. A lot of writers, when they write about big, sweeping themes, betray themselves as extraverts. Each style can be done well. Weiseman happens to do the introvert version very well&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The book is pegged around some major world events. And they are important. The book wouldn’t be the same without its transnational components. But as a reader, you’ll learn far more about the relationships between the main characters in this book than anything else. And stepping into historical fiction is often more about the fiction part than the history, for me anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>The Martian</title>

&lt;p&gt;I should lay out some of my biases up front. I love heady films. I tend to find more to connect with in movies that explore characters’ inner worlds. If a film plays out some crisis, some frictions in identity, makes some observations about geo-political relationships through a family dynamic perhaps; I’m all in. Those are the types of films I usually find interesting, worth thinking and writing about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Martian had little to none of these qualities. For a man stranded on another planet, facing almost certain death, or years of loneliness at best, Mark Watney seemed to suffer little to no emotional trauma. For all the difficult relationships China and the US have politically, none of it seemed to matter (beyond a quick scene among Chinese scientists agreeing to skirt their government) when it came to collaboration between space agencies to rescue Watney.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But all of those things are beside the point. The Martian is a clear and unequivocal celebration. It is a fun to watch, it looked like it was fun to make, and I think it’ll be fun to come back to. Big chunks of the movie are basically the scenes with Gary Sinese and Clint Howard from Apollo 13 (some of the best parts of Apollo 13). In a landscape of sequels, derivatives, and uninspiring blockbusters, The Martian is a fresh, creative new voice. Sometimes, all you want from a film is to have fun. This film is fun without being dumb or appealing to lesser instincts.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://letterboxd.com/samarthbhaskar/film/magnolia/&quot;&gt;LetterboxD review link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Magnolia was the quickest 3 hour movie I can imagine watching. In fact, there were times, especially with the music was relentless and the audience nary given a break that I found myself swelling with emotion and feeling almost dizzy things were moving so fast. It was a sustained crescendo that PTA pulled longer than comfortable to break down my walls as a viewer. This risk paid off, and subsequent risks, like the Aimee Mann musical sing-along, and a risky ending became much more appreciable because my walls were down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This film is an achievement in editing, for its transitions between stories. This film is also an achievement in directing, for soliciting performances from each actor in the best, most appropriate, way. The director had a fully realized version of this story in his mind, which comes across through the plotting, acting and shooting of the film. Each actor shines, from Tom Cruise’s energetic, vibrant, force of emotion to Philip Baker Hall’s more subdued but powerful mumbling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These features work in Magnolia’s favor. But what keeps it from achieving the level of success of Boogie Nights, There Will Be Blood or The Master is that the underling story isn’t as fully realized. PTA had themes as big as any of those other films in mind, but they don’t come across on screen as well. If a film could be judged entirely on how well the director and writer bear witness to their characters’ lives, PTA may have accomplished a new height in Magnolia. But a film needs more than to present un-judged, unvarnished characters - it needs a point. Magnolia seemed to be less sure about its point than some of PTA’s other works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dennis Villeneuve directed one of my favorite films of the past 5 years, Incendies. I didn’t realize before stepping in to Sicario that this was a film by the same director. However, after learning of the connection, the similarities are very clear. The biggest departure, however, was that the female protagonist in Sicario doesn’t play as central a role as the female protagonist in Incendies. Kate (Emily Blunt) serves more as a filter, maybe a filament, through whom we watch the stories of Alejandro and Matt fold out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Matt and Alejandro, Josh Brolin and Benicio del Toro respectively, are distillations of the American government and the drug cartels it is supposed to oppose. But, it becomes clear in this movie and in life, that these institutions are not always at odds. In fact, sometimes they have to work together to achieve similar, if slightly perpendicular, goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of this plays out in a simple, stripped down, lightly plotted film. There are only a few action (very good) scenes, but a dreadful feeling is present throughout. In part because of a pressing score and in part because of classic Roger Deakins cinematography.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Near the end of the film, Alejandro tells Kate, “you should move to a small town. You won’t survive here. You’re not a wolf, this is a land for wolves now.” That’s the director’s biggest accomplishment. It is abundantly clear by the end of the film, that there are parts of the United States that mirror a war zone more than they mirror the United States I live in every day. If Zero Dark Thirty ended with a reflection on how America has changed as a result of wars abroad, this film is a clear argument that America has changed, also, because of wars within.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Meet the Patels</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://letterboxd.com/samarthbhaskar/film/meet-the-patels/&quot;&gt;LetterboxD review link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I saw Meet the Patels last week, but it has taken me a few days to get some emotional distance from it and write about it. On its face, Meet the Patels is funny, earnest, a new voice in a crowded space. It is made with shaky hands but steady voices. It is by and large an accurate account of growing up as an Indian American. It gets a lot of the details right, including the difficult emotional relationships some young Indian Americans have with their parents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is all these things, but for me, it was something else. It was a depiction of my life on screen. In particular, of parts of my life that aren’t always funny and light. Marriage is a difficult topic in some Indian families. For some families, marriage is the institution responsible for keeping women in relationships they should have left long ago. For some families, marriage is the only topic of discussion, especially if you happen to be a son or daughter in your 20s, settled into the beginning of your career, and single. And for these 20-year-old sons and daughters, marriage becomes a weight that gets heavier and heavier with each year. The weight is exactly proportional to the amount of guilt sons and daughters feel for letting their parents down. Geeta, at one point, says that she realized it wasn’t exactly because of her parents she felt this way, but I would argue that it was. If the signals she received from her family were love and acceptance, the weight of marriage would be lighter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Marriage is an inevitability in Indian culture. It is the main institution through which all identities are formed. In a culture so defined by social relations, marriage is front and center, a gravity from which no one can escape. So when you take these cultural histories, and put them in America, a place with its own institutions with their own gravities, frictions are bound to happen. In America, a culture more interested in individual identities, marriage can easily be replaced by things like race, work, or politics. And this central conflict is present in Meet the Patels. Ravi and Geeta want to define themselves through their work, their friends, their communities, but they keep getting pulled back into the Indian marriage black hole.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this way, I felt more kinship with Geeta and Audrey, than Ravi. That’s a weird thing to say if you’re a 27 year old Indian-American man, watching a 29 year old Indian-American man on screen. But I found more to connect with Geeta and Audrey, two women who were trying their best not to let marriage define them. They were swimming against the current, trying their best to pull away from the pull of marriage. Ravi, partly because of his own choice and partly because the pull of marriage had him rapt, spent many years thinking about and defining himself in relation to marriage. Where I am in life, right now, I don’t feel connected to that approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end, their parents did come around to accepting Ravi and Geeta’s identities. And that was heartening to see. I think most parents get their after some struggles. But some don’t, some stay stubborn. If I could, I’d tell every father and mother to get there earlier, to default to giving their children love and acceptance. Love and acceptance shouldn’t be contingent on something like marriage. It should come first, and marriage should flow from it, if it so happens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It took me a while to realize this about Woody Allen films, and Hannah and her Sisters’ inclusion of Mia Farrow may have congealed the thought finally, but the way to understand the many films Woody Allen has made in the past decades is to realize each one is about him. Woody Allen, in his own acerbic, mumbling way, has accomplished what many writers and authors hope to accomplish - he has built an entire oeuvre out of nothing but his own life. An argument could be made, especially with films like Hannah, Annie Hall, Midnight in Paris and most recently Irrational Man, that every year or two Woody Allen writes and directs a film about himself and his life. A small percentage of people have ever written an autobiography or a memoir, let alone one every year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many writers, arguably every memoirist, have set out to create a work of art from their inner life. Woody Allen has accomplished this feat over and again, year after year. He writes characters that all sound, act, and live life like him. Every character in Hannah could be imagined to be a version of Allen. And although Allen remains entirely outside the film, despite playing a central character, if you take the sum total of the complications, behaviors and experiences of these characters, you might create a version pretty close to Woody Allen himself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What’s most important about this is that Allen has made an entire career of telling stories about his own life, some embellished, others more direct. Many writers I can think of would be very jealous of this accomplishment. To live a full and vibrant inner life, and then to make a living telling stories crafted from that inner life, well that’s the goal isn’t it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Allen strays from this formula sometimes. This is when missteps in his filmography are clear. Films like Match Point come to mind. These leaps away from himself tend to fall flat, arguably because he’s just not good when he’s not writing about himself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without mentioning all the other accomplishments of Hannah and her Sisters (the role of music, Michael Caine’s terrific performance, its depiction of gender and race in New York), the film and Woody Allen are impressive. One cannot be impressed with Woody Allen’s writing without noting also that his inner life is full of some questionable details. But whose isn’t?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had the chance to see The Lobster at the 2015 NY Film Festival. Yorgos Lanthimos was in attendance and during a Q&amp;amp;A afterward he mentioned that he moved to the UK about 4 years ago. He said he had an explicit goal to work on an English language project after Dogtooth and Alps. About 4 years ago is also when Greece (Lanthimos’ home) began to show serious signs of financial and political trouble. While watching The Lobster, this wasn’t front of mind for me, but after the screening ended, I did wonder: did the fall of the Greek economy, the rise of Syriza and the fundamental questions Greece has asked itself in the last few years affect Lanthimos’ work. Greece has had to rethink grand parts of its society and how they will move forward. The answer is most likely a yes, but the degree to which Lanthimos is aware of the effects is debatable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Lobster presented a fascinating exploration of the huge stake that society has in love, relationships and procreation. So many of our public policy decisions turn on the idea that society should encourage people to fall in love, pair off, procreate and grow families. In a world that has basically accepted that as fact, what happens to single people, to people uninterested or unable to find partners? In Europe where populations are declining, in Japan where cultural frictions between traditional courting and Western influence, in addition to declining economic prospects are causing young people to change sexual practices, how are these norms changing and evolving? This is something I, personally, have been thinking about a lot these days as a young, single, urban male. My interest in partnering is dwindling while my peers are getting engaged and married almost by the hour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In The Lobster, Lanthimos explores these ideas in dark, comedic, often hilarious ways. The world he creates in a resort for single people and couples, a city, a forest, are all beautifully depicted. The main performances, especially by Colin Farrell, provide a great partnership for the story to unfold. My description so far makes the film sound far more heady and intellectual than it feels. Largely due to the choices in language, the pared down but engaging performances and the wise choice of both the director and the actors to not take themselves too seriously, the film flows well from beginning to end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My only criticism, if I can level any, is that the end of the third act took a few unnecessary steps and got away from the central themes of the film. But it’s hard to make that argument too strongly given how many people in the theater were collectively holding their breaths as the credits began to roll.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Phoenix</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://letterboxd.com/samarthbhaskar/film/phoenix-2014/&quot;&gt;LetterboxD review link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Phoenix is as complete a film as I’ve seen this year. I was hesitant to check out a couple of weeks ago after I read a lot of critical praise for it online, mostly because I’ve found WWII and Holocaust themed films to be pretty tiring in the last few years. A few years ago, I remember noticing that every film in the foreign category at the Oscars was about the holocaust. But Phoenix is much less about the Holocaust than about the effect of war and tragedy on people, relationships and countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s been cited in many places, but the 3rd act and especially the ending of this film really lives up to the hype. The crescendo of emotion happens slowly throughout the film and when you think it’s really going to kick in, Petzold takes up only a few notches and leaves you breathless. That’s the trick of good film, it leaves you believing that it’s only because of good acting, or editing, or directing that you’re impressed, but in fact it’s everything in unison.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides all the technical and cinematic details of the film, my favorite part were the allegories to Israel and Germany’s national identities post WWII. Israel, a nation rising from the ashes of the Holocaust, full of people who barely recognize themselves, searching for an identity but unsure of how to incorporate their past into their future. Germany, reeling with the lasting legacy of betrayal, no ability to lay claim to any sort of moral high ground, unsure of its footing immediately after the war and unsure of how long it would remain this way. During the current European migrant and financial crises, Germany is still riddled with the burdens of the Holocaust, almost 80 years later. These complicated national identities were referenced throughout the film but you never felt like you left the story of a man and a woman with desires, conflicts, pasts and futures. It’s an accomplishment in writing, directing and acting to &lt;em&gt;show&lt;/em&gt; a story while &lt;em&gt;telling&lt;/em&gt; some grand truths about the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Elaine May’s gritty, quiet, masterpiece can be studied through a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/11/a-mans-world-movies-richard-brody&quot;&gt;feminist lens&lt;/a&gt;. There’s plenty to discuss about the editing choices, successes, and, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rogerebert.com/rogers-journal/variety-this-thumbs-for-you&quot;&gt;failures&lt;/a&gt;. There’s also a worthwhile discussion to be had about whether May would’ve been better off just remaining a writer instead of a director for this &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.larsenonfilm.com/mikey-and-nicky&quot;&gt;film&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of these are worthy reactions to the film, and among the things I thought about during and after the movie. But the overwhelming sensation I had during the film was awe. I was in awe of the acting on display by Peter Falk and John Cassavetes. One scene after another, through dialog, through brief looks, through runs in wet streets; these actors took every opportunity afforded them by the script to display these characters for us the audience. For hours after the film, I found myself thinking about the relationship between Mikey and Nicky. I thought about their past, about the times together as kids, as young adults, as mobsters. That effect is directly related to the amount of life on display for these characters by two committed, talented, passionate actors. Their performances were worth the price of admission alone.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Negroland - A Memoir</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Negroland has gathered a lot of attention in the past few weeks. It wasn’t on most critics’ summer lists for books we’d be chattering about this fall, but it has made its way onto those lists now. Margo Jefferson has been promoting her book on podcasts and through interviews in the last few weeks. I’ve listened to a handful and happily found that the kind of wisdom she puts on display in the book is present outside the book too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In Negroland, Jefferson plays with form, structure and conceptions of truth. These choices help us, the readers, remember that a memoir is not a history. It is not the facts as they were, but the facts as the writers was. I appreciated that Jefferson took ~30 pages to set up some historical context, removing herself from her own memoir before jumping into her life. The context setting was necessary for those of us unfamiliar with the history of the kind of place and people she wrote about. Her constant unsettling of perspective, voice and place reminded me of David Carr’s memoir “The Night of the Gun” which also played with form in a similar way to make the point over and again that this retelling of a life cannot and is not perfect. It is the author’s interpretation and projection of what happened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another book I was reminded of was Tanehisi Coates’ “Between the world and me”. The recent memoir, about similar cultural topics, also featured beautiful prose and big language. This stylistic similarity helped lift both books off the page and into my imagination. If they had been written in more cold, critical style, their impact would have been lessened. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But more than anything else, I enjoyed Negroland because of Jefferson’s brilliant descriptions of the differences between privilege and entitlement. Her ability to inspect her own intersecting identities - woman, black, young, militant, intelligent, depressed, among others - and place these identities against the backdrop of 1950s, 60s and 70s Chicago described some uniquely American experiences. These are the kinds of descriptions and comparisons that help us learn about our country, our times and ourselves. And these are the lessons we must learn if we hope to build a future that isn’t mired in our past’s mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In all honesty, I really wasn’t expecting part II to be a full step up from part I. But with excellent editing, remarkable action sequences, great acting, and tight plotting, part II really shines above and beyond part I.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gangs of Wasseypur should absolutely be considered an epic. Not only because of its grand aims to tell a story spanning over 80 years, but because of its ability to capture life in India, especially the intersections of independence, development of civil society, effects of the Permit Raj, and interplay of state and federal politics, so well. Kashyap did not shy away from any part of this challenge. It takes immense talent to both build characters and get the audience to buy into their lives, their fears and dreams, while telling a larger story about human nature, society, governance and violence. Kashyap, masterfully, accomplished both.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My original question, though, from Part I, still remains unanswered. Why focus on a muslim family? I suppose the answer may be as simple as the fact that the town where this happened, the family on which it is based, was Muslim. But in a country with a long history of treating Muslims are hyper-violent, ill-fitting members of society, this question is worth asking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Part 1 down, part 2 to follow. I hope I get an answer to my main question, which is simply - “why a Muslim family?” There are plenty of stories to be told about Hindu mafias and violence. Something peculiar about picking out a Muslim story to tell. But I’ll hold off on making any claims until I’ve seen part 2.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Franzen took a long time and a lot of pages to get through only a few topics. A lot of this book, I found, boring and unnecessary. But, to his credit, he pulled things together in the last 150 pages, and made the pay off worth it. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Franzen had to plot heavily to keep the book moving, which was the right move, because his talents lie in his writing. However, the plot could scarcely hide the fact that his lack of talent as a social critic or social theorist comes across throughout this book. Throughout the different plot vehicles - yuppie and counter culture in San Francisco, a bungled nuclear bomb theft, a secret internet-enabled society run out of Bolivia, a newspaper exposing state and non-state secrets in Denver - Franzen tries to explore ideas around purity, secret, family, modern communication, modern sexual relations, but no major thesis can be found. Ultimately, there’s too much of Franzen in this book for it to be a smart political, feminist or social critique. The issues he’s chosen to talk about, especially in a modern context which he has chosen willfully to live outside of, are not discussed convincingly precisely because he knows little about them. I get it, he finds the internet distracting and unfriendly to deep exploration so he abstains from it. If that’s the case, then he shouldn’t pick it up as a topic of exploration. You can’t have it both ways. You can’t say “I don’t like the internet and won’t have anything to do with it,” and also wax poetic about its effects on society when you know so little.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All that being said, there was one aspect of the main topic - purity - I found interesting. The idea of moral absolutism. Extremism is very much part of our modern world, but we only really see it discussed in the context of religion and that too largely non-Western religions. But Franzen explored purity or the extreme seeking of moral high ground in family, with secrets, with asymmetric information, with nations and in friendships. These explorations were fraught with rich ideas and worthy of both the author’s writing talent and the reader’s intrigue.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://letterboxd.com/samarthbhaskar/film/meru/&quot;&gt;LetterboxD review link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can’t believe how talented Jimmy Chin is. A world class climber, skier, photographer, cinematographer, director, and now documentarian. Meru did not feel like a debut documentary. All the footage, editing and pacing felt very well situated among contemporary documentaries. If I had to guess, this is largely because he studied the genre. Like his knowledge of climbing and mountaineering, success depends to a great degree on study and preparation. I imagine Chin and his collaborators studied the genre before producing this film. The biggest missing piece, though, was that Chin’s talents are clear as a mountain climber and photographer but a little less impressive as a theorist. Bringing in Jon Krakauer, chronicler of all things weird or extreme in America, was helpful but an overall theory of why men would attempt to ascend this mountain was lacking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was a small plot point but one that stuck with me. I found it so strange that Conrad Anker married his best friend’s wife after seeing his best friend die in an avalanche. He was clearly suffering deeply from survivor’s guilt, but coming home, falling in love with your best friend’s widow and adopting his children - what a torrent of emotions that must create. Marriage is complicated enough, introducing this huge wrinkle seems incredible to me. But then, I guess “not-incredible” is not a description of a man who climbs a mountain for 20 days. I was even more fascinated with what their kids must think of all this. What if they just wanted a normal life?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My favorite part of the documentary and of their approach to mountaineering was that everything was assessed as a risk with a probability of success or failure. There are very few things we do in life that have zero prior belief or information to assess probabilities. I try to made decisions in my life in this way, but seeing it applied to something on the scale of mountaineering was amazing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Best of Enemies was funny, mostly light-hearted, and tried to treat both central figures equitably. But Buckley’s influence over modern conservatism, arguably, looms larger than Vidal’s over modern liberalism. This makes any equitable treatment of them as central characters in a documentary a difficult task. However, through strong editing and use of archival footage Best of Enemies gets close to accomplishing this task.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also liked the little but effective use of narration from Kelsey Grammar and John Lithgow, although I would’ve swapped the two. Lithgow should have definitely narrated Buckley’s passages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m basically asking for a different documentary when I say this, I realize, but I would’ve loved to learn more about Buckley and Vidal’s upbringing. Their outsider status as Eastern elites, but then almost complete adoption of East coast elitism was fascinating. Over their careers they became synonymous with East-coast intellectual elites but didn’t start out in that pedigree. Their Horatio Algerian mythical upbringings and rises to fame, undoubtedly, informed their politics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Queen of Earth features great cinematography, which creates an atmospheric feel, especially during the few night scenes which let in very little light. The use of 16-mm cameras, a small location and few characters situates this film among many like it in the 70s and 80s. The best scene in the film features slow camera work, capturing dialog, and superb performances from both Moss and Waterston telling break up stories. I wished for more of this type of dialog but Alex Ross Perry seems more interested in asking questions, creating mysteries than answering anything or creating comfort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Elizabeth Moss can do anything. Between movies like this, The One I love, and shows like Mad Men and Top of the Lake, she has earned her place among actors who can count on me as an audience member for pretty much anything they want to put on screen. All the close ups could be described as claustrophobic, but I felt they could more aptly be considered overwhelming. The same way in which the emotions in this film seem to overwhelm its main characters. Moss rises to the challenge and uses these close ups to display her command of her face, body, and thoughts as an actor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One drawback, however, is the consideration that this film and a lot of films it’s paying homage to (Bergman, Polanski, Allen, to name a few) is about crazy women as created by men watching from a distance. That doesn’t in and of itself have to be problematic but when it happens so many times over so many decades it should make us question - what is it about men telling the story of crazy women we find so enthralling. And should we be participating in this practice? I suppose it helps that Alex Ross Perry is aware of this and dealt with it in some way in Listen Up Phillip, but I don’t know if it’s enough to get a get-out-of-jail free card.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Kitchens of the Great Midwest captures the midwest really well. The influence of Lutheranism, the cultural battles between young urban-minded and older smaller community oriented citizens, the effect of lots of driving, building communities around things like food and church because there isn’t much else to bond over – all of this rang true for me as someone raised in Illinois. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But beyond being a capsule of a time and place, J. Ryan Stradal wrote a great family novel in his debut work. It’s easy to forget the book is essentially about the relationship between a mother and daughter, because for the majority of the book this relationship isn’t a focus. But an argument could be made that everything that happens to and around Eva is related to her relationship with her mother. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s easy to read this novel as pure entertainment - there’s plenty of humor, action and character sugar to keep any reader entertained - but the author managed to also do some great anthropological, moralistic and ethicist work alongside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I liked this movie. I think I would like a septuagenarian rom-com between Lily Tomlin and Sam Elliot more. Basically, I would like Lily Tomlin to have the late-career boom that Betty White had a few years ago. It would be way more interesting, I’d guess.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://letterboxd.com/samarthbhaskar/film/the-end-of-the-tour/&quot;&gt;LetterboxD review link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I saw THE END OF THE TOUR a few weeks ago, but I’ve been struggling to write about it since. This is in part because I loved the movie a lot and felt I couldn’t do it justice without some time to process it. It also affected me, on an emotional level, in a way that required some time to gain emotional distance from it. Then I started procrastinating because of the Wallace-bros backlash. I didn’t want to get painted into the same light as some Franzen, Wallace loving anti-feminist, cutesy pomo, uncritical consumer. But the truth is, I feel a strong connection to Wallace. And if that is how a lot of other middle class [people who imagine themselves to be] white dudes my age feel, so be it, it doesn’t diminish what is true for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a lot of in common with DFW. He was born in Champaign IL, where I went to college. In the late 90s he lived in Bloomington IL, where I grew up at the same time. I didn’t know of him then and his memory is still only minimally important to most people in my hometown but I’d like to think something of both our sensibilities was shaped by Central IL. Wallace was a moderately successful high school athlete as a tennis player, and I had a little of the same as a swimmer. In the Midwest, where there is little to get excited about, getting even a little taste of notoriety can shape a teenager’s world view. More than any of these biographic particulars, Wallace and I share a propensity toward depression and anxiety that endears him to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;THE END OF THE TOUR is entirely written and made through David Lipsky’s eyes. In fact, I don’t think you could make a movie about Wallace through Wallace’s own perspective. It would be too exhausting to watch. It would be too self-critical and unenjoyable. This film captured, really well, what winter in the midwest in the late 90s was like. I first moved to Bloomington in 1999, a couple of years after the setting of this movie. The drab, flat colors, dark moonless nights, huge distance between destinations, lack of civil society outside of church and restaurants all came together to capture what it was like to live in Central IL in the late 90s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing, in particular, I’ve been thinking about a lot is what possible connection there may be between Wallace’s depression/anxiety and the Midwest. It’s hard to argue this point beyond just conjecture, but there’s something about the Midwest that exacerbates depression and anxiety. Especially for the type of guy that Wallace was. He was supremely concerned about what other people thought of him. This is not entirely unconnected to the influence of Lutheranism and Protestantism in the Midwest. Lutheranism and Protestantism, unlike other major religions is very concerned with community. Almost like the Protestant Ethic thesis applied not to the spread of capitalism but to communalism. This influence looms large in the character that social interactions take in the Midwest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another feature of the Midwest contributed to the odds stacked against Wallace’s sadness - the distance between people. Wallace spent a lot of time worrying about what someone may be thinking of him. In an urban environment, you interact with so many people so many times in a day, you come to realize quickly that most people, most of the time, are not thinking about you. They have on their minds only their lives. When you put so much distance between people, like the Midwest does, you can go on creating realities in your head that do not match reality outside. I wonder if urban living could’ve been a saving grace for Wallace, as it has for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m glad this movie was made, despite hesitations from Wallace’s estate. I get their argument that to get know Wallace, one must simply read his writing. But, simply, it’s not very simple to read his writing. I think this film will be a good introduction to Wallace for a whole new audience. It also helps that the dialog between Wallace and Lipsky, the main focus of the film, stayed true to Wallace’s writing style.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went to see this at BAM tonight where Baumbach attended for Q&amp;amp;A. He drew some comparisons between Frances Ha, While We’re Young and this film. Frances Ha features a similar, strong, female, eccentric protagonist. If Frances Ha paid homage to French New Wave, Mistress America pays homage to screwball and odd couple comedies. While We’re young has similar main focal relationship between younger and older protagonists. The younger is in love with the older but doesn’t really understand the complications of older. Eventually the younger falls out of love, while we go on some sort of emotional journey too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Baumbach edited this while making and finishing While We’re Young. The inspiration he had in Frances Ha seemed to have been quelled or worse, lost. He lost some of his sureness during While We’re Young and it shows in the 3rd act of this film. I felt this while watching While We’re Young and seeing him struggle with Ben Stiller’s director-character. I fear some of that crisis of confidence may have watered down Mistress America too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 3rd act, where the screwball antics are really turned up, feels like the end of one of those TLC cake-making competitions. The part where the chefs have assembled the cake backstage, but it’s all precarious and they have to carry it to the judges very carefully; the whole time we feel like it could all fall apart. In this case, the cake shakes quite a bit, but it basically stays together. But it was really close to falling apart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The thing I was most interested in were the connections to America. If I could’ve gotten a question in I would’ve asked Baumbach what Tracy or Brooke say about America, in his estimation. Does he think America is perpetually stuck in young-adulthood? Does he think America is earnest, but uncouth, lovable but deluded? Brooke ends up paying her debts and moving on, maybe even growing up and becoming something new, can America do this? Brooke keeps referring to her upbringing, “I wasn’t brought up that way,” as the reason why she is the way she is. Does Baumbach think America can shed its past? Become something it wasn’t brought up to be? Or am I pulling out inferences where none exist?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s plenty to complain about - a lack of imagination on the director’s part, unnecessary gratuitous sex scenes, a third act that becomes a little too “Behind The Music”-esque but overall this was a solid film. Biopics, especially about groups, especially about music groups are hard to do, but the writers pulled this off well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was most impressed with the cast and their performances. I didn’t know until after that O’Shea Jackson Jr. Ice Cube’s real life son, played him in the movie. The whole time I was marveling at how good the casting was for that part. Jason Mitchell, who played Easy E, carried the film emotionally with aplomb.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More than anything else, I’m glad this film was made to commemorate an important moment in the history of Hip Hop, art, and contemporary America. Not to mention, properly elevating two huge American artists - Ice Cube and Dr. Dre. It boggles the mind to think about how much success Dre has had in the last 30 years. He walked away, multiple times, from hugely successful enterprises to come back again more successfully. A Horatio Alger for contemporary times if there ever was one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not as much of an exploration of authenticity in documentary as STORIES WE TELL but it was up there. Burre has a quality that I often pick up on when I’m hanging out with “theater-types.” They seem to be hyper aware that someone is watching, even if no one is watching. This quality is even more heightened when a camera is around. Sometimes I wonder if they can even control this, or if this is what led them to acting in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A review I read somewhere claimed this was more for Woody Allen completists rather than general audiences. I agree with this statement. There’s not much new or note worthy in this film.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, even in an average year, the aging Woody Allen does better work than most. And if you watch this film with Allen’s personal life in mind, there are some interesting moments. Allen’s always fancied himself a pseudo-intellectual and through this main character he gets to take a turn as a philosophy professor. Unfortunately, it’s pretty clear that beyond a few intro-to-philosophy books, Allen hasn’t really grappled with the continentals or the analytical philosophers. To say nothing of anything outside the French and German post-war period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many actors have taken a turn in playing Woody Allen, or the Woody Allen type, on screen. Owen Wilson was great in Midnight in Paris. Cate Blanchett, wonderful in Blue Jasmine. But I don’t think Joaquin Phoenix quite fit the bill. It seems to me Phoenix prefers to get lost inside the minds of his characters, to take a total vacation from his life into whatever might be going on in his character’s life. To play an Allen like character, however, requires the actor to be hyper-aware of the world around him. The anxieties, twitches and self-awareness that Allen-types require, it seems to me, is just not the type of thing Phoenix is interested in doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I gave up on expecting greatness from Fuqua. In fact, I went back and re-watched Training Day not too long ago and the shape of his career after 2001 tainted my viewing of that film too. Maybe without Denzel’s assistance, Fuqua would’ve never really made a splash.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, when actors consistently turn out strong performances in films by the same director - Don Cheadle in Brooklyn’s Finest, Denzel Washington in Training Day, Ethan Hawke in both of those and now Gyllenhaal, Whitaker, McAdams and the breakout star Oona Laurence playing their daughter - you start to wonder if the bulk of Fuqua’s talent lies in letting actors put on great performances. That’s nothing to balk at. So perhaps I had the wrong read on Fuqua, and should instead praise him for what he’s good at - directing actors. Instead of being disappointed in what he’s not so good at - creating, new, unique world views through his films.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of overt themes about statecraft, post-nationalism, the IMF as a stand in for global organizations, and some half-baked ideas about what the Washington Consensus looks like 30 years after it was coined.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But look at those action sequences! They’re so fun!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t want to elevate this film next to some of the 4 and 5-star reviews I’ve given on this site, but the 3-star review might not convey how much I enjoyed this film. It is deceptively simple. It succeeds because of its restraint.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Tanehisi Coates, rightly, places this book right after his earlier memoir The Beautiful Struggle and smack dab in the middle of the canon of black literature with an homage to James Baldwin. In Struggle, Coates described his childhood and adolescence and the influence of his father. In Between the World and Me, he picks up as a young adult and young father. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every time I’ve seen Coates interviewed or brought on for a talking-head media appearance, before he can even complete his point, he’s inevitably asked, “so then what’s the answer? If America is so wrong in all these ways, how do we fix it?” And this is where I see Coates’ spirit dampen. I think he’s sick of trying to answer this question. Partially because he hasn’t come up with an answer he believes in yet. And partially because he doesn’t think it’s his job. As a country, we haven’t even agreed on the problem, or that there is a problem, how are we supposed to jump to a solution? In fact, solutionism sometimes is harmful. Trying to duct-tape together some theory of hope or change without actually coming to consensus on what is ailing America is unlikely to help. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you’ve ever been to therapy, you might be familiar with this approach. You can walk into a therapist’s office and say “I’m in a bad place, tell me what to do and I’ll do it. How can I fix this?” A therapist, if they’re a good one at least, will likely deny you that satisfaction. Maybe they’ll give you some quick fixes to help you deal with an emergency, but they’ll also advocate for deep, long, introspection. A study of your entire life. Until you deeply understand fundamental truths about how you got to where you are, long lasting change is not possible. America is interested in a quick fix, when she needs long lasting change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it isn’t a question about a solution, or sometimes in addition to this question, his interlocutor might ask “is it hopeless? Should we give up hope on fixing any of this?” His response here, again, is instructive. Coates, and I’m paraphrasing, says “no, giving up isn’t an option. No one before us gave up, it is upon us now to carry this fight for the generations that will come after us.” And in this way, he models hope better than most people having this conversation. He loves this country, he wants to see it work. Coates isn’t, and I’m not, a religious man, but this is (Christian) grace personified. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He isn’t right about everything. He isn’t right to hit his son. He isn’t right to gloss over the experience of black women, to lump the particular types of violence leveled against them with all violence. But he learned to say “I love you” to his son. Maybe he’ll learn to listen to and amplify black women’s experience as its own distinct violence. And maybe America, too, will learn and change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a sad, sad film. Amy Winehouse’s life was tragic. The viewer gets little or no reprieve from this sadness; I can only imagine how Amy Winehouse must’ve felt getting no reprieve from her own sadness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kapadia makes some choices that more or less pay off. His use of off-screen interviews, brilliant editing of home, TV, and archival footage and Amy Winehouse’s own lyrics and voice serve to create a real intimacy with Winehouse’s life and struggles. These choices could’ve fallen flat but for the most part Kapadia is successful in carrying a story with these devices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I couldn’t help but compare this documentary to the recently released WHAT HAPPENED, MISS SIMONE. Two troubled, genius, female pop singers. Both revered by their contemporaries, critically successful, but battling demons in their own lives. Both caught up with nasty men. Both caught in the spell of drugs (medicinal or otherwise) that rendered their powers inert for a time. I appreciated MISS SIMONE’s cultural context and political commentary and wished AMY had some of the same. But it seems Kapadia wasn’t out to say anything about the world, just to tell the story of a tortured soul.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had a friend growing up, A, who had a live in maid that raised him, J. I spent a lot of time with A, our families were close, so I was basically raised by her too. We spent a lot of time making trouble for her and eating food she made for us. J was undoubtedly part of A’s family. I left India at 10 and never saw J since. We talked on the phone with her once. I also lost touch with A. That’s how childhood friendships go sometimes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Roger and Ah Tao’s relationship reminded me a lot of A and J. I wonder if A would be as loving and caring as Roger was. I would like to think that he would.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This movie did a great job keeping its restraint, not erring on the side of high dramatics, relying on its very talented main actors and using the scenery of Hong Kong, the tone of colors the cityscape provided and conversational dialog to move things along.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This wasn’t the right place or the right mood but I couldn’t help but think about that despite how much love Roger has for Ah Tao and generally how well his family treats her, it saddens me that we live in a world where she remains a maid, never getting the chance to pursue her own career, family or home. We have to believe, almost immediately, in the capitalist project in order to see the main relationship in this movie as one characterized by love and generosity instead of imbalanced power and Marxist alienation. Given how entrenched in the capitalist project our world is, especially a place like Hong Kong, that’s not much of a leap. I’d love to see a version of this movie in which Roger and Ah Tao are actually equals, not just in each other’s eyes but in society’s eyes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Her face: the documentary featured a lot of footage of Nina Simone performing. Her face was almost as enticing as her voice. Every performance could be summed up in a few facial gestures. Her face betrayed her mood, her attitude, her commitment to what she was singing about, or her complete disinterest in having to perform sometimes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Her voice: what is voice? In basic terms, it’s hot air and some energy created through constricting and releasing muscles. It can be described in very mechanical terms, rendering it sterile. But what came out of Nina Simone, disguised as her voice, was much more than this. Somewhere between the breath she inhaled and the words she sang, she infused something metaphysical. This last ingredient was patently hers. It was some parts pain, some parts anger, some parts love, some parts fear. This is the last ingredient that sent shivers up and down my body in the dark theater where I watched this film. This was her contribution to the world - the world of music, civil rights, pop culture and the world at large.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the theater where I was watching this film, a woman was letting out audible sighs and affirmations when Nina Simone’s life moved her. She was clearly affected by some of the civil rights era documentary. A man behind her kept shushing her. A few times he did this loudly. Then he took a swipe at her had, as if to slap her. She stood up, turned around and took a swing at him. A fight almost broke out. In the end they ended up sitting down and watching the rest of the movie instead of getting kicked out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I couldn’t help but reflect on the irony of a white man, paying money to go see a movie about a tortured, silenced black woman, only to do the same to a black woman in the theater with him.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This is an easy-to-read, very difficult book. Sharma does not shy away from the ugliest, most difficult subjects but writes about them so fluidly that you find yourself going along at a steady clip, jaw dropping wider and wider. Much like the subjects of abuse in this book, the reader at times can feel like he’s in an abusive relationship he just can’t pull away from. That’s not meant to demean or minimize actual abuse victims suffer. It’s only meant to highlight how deftly Sharma captures abuse of all kind (institutional, familial, cultural, structural) and grabs your attention with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The portions of this book that deal with the machinations of corruption in India were less engaging in comparison to the personal stories. I say this as someone who is very interested (and relatively well informed) about Indian politics and Indian political history, especially post-Independence pre-globalized India. It seems it was hard for Sharma to turn his talents into the same success while talking about structural political and economic abuse as it was for him to talk about familial, personal abuse. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With this and his newer novel Family Life, I’ve developed a strong sense of respect and admiration for Sharma. He is one of the sharpest writers writing today. He brings me great hope as a fellow Indian American man, that some parts of my life and my experience may be immortalized through his gaze.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The soundtrack, style and 90s references may be enough to enjoy DOPE, which is by and large enjoyable. But I gather that writer director Rick Famuyiwa set out to do more than make an enjoyable movie. And in that goal, I’m afraid he fell short.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DOPE is very particularly of its time. Technology is integral to its plot, cultural references abound and it is in conversation with the many films that make up its genre. However, much like the time it’s from, DOPE starts with a new idea and fails to see it through to completion. The new idea with which it starts is “what is life like for a geek in Englewood?” After that however, it falls into a morass of subplots, side-characters and a scattershot tone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oddly enough, DOPE’s central character has a strong sense of identity. He knows who he is. And he continues to be himself in the midst of a lot of pressure to change. He comes out strongly against cliche. Unfortunately, the film in which he is cast does not have the same backbone. DOPE, like a teenager clinging to whatever sways him/her in any direction (or like Bobby Jindal, similarly lacking a strong sense of self), is missing a central identity. DOPE doesn’t end up as a cliche, entirely (although the ending comes close with its didactic turn), but it just doesn’t have an identity for the viewer to hang on to or be inspired from.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sidenote: I re-watched HIGH FIDELITY earlier this week and Zoe Kravitz looks &lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt; like her mom Lisa Bonet from that film. In fact it took me a while to believe that it wasn’t 2000 Lisa Bonet starring in a 2015 film.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It’s hard to say about a 550+ page book that you didn’t want it to end. But that’s how I felt upon finishing Wolitzer’s The Interestings. Meg Wolitzer did the right thing by following these characters across decades, because this book could’ve been about success or talent in a shorter time period but the point would not have been the same. Talent ebbs and flows over a life, but success takes a lifetime’s worth of commitment to achieve. Not to mention a lot of luck. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’m in a part of my life now where the pace of change has slowed. Every additional year is less and less different from every previous year. That was not true of my teenage years. My life at 12 was pretty substantially different from my life at 13. I don’t foresee my life at 28 being as different from my life now at 27. This makes it easy to picture how the next 5, 10, 20, 40 years might look. With that perspective, living life with the characters in this book for a while was fun. I liked thinking about how Jules related to Ethan, a man she had known for decades. Or about what space Goodman occupied in Ethan’s brain. Blood didn’t bond these people, but they ended up being in each other’s lives as long as some family members are. And even after decades, they could, in an instant, go back to the feeling of first meeting and getting to know each other. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a close group of friends like this, people I got know as a teenager and college student. I expect to know and be close to them for many years. We’ll go through many experiences together. But, even now, I can in an instant go back and wonder what it would’ve been like to never meet them. I can recall a time when I didn’t know them. I can recall formative moments when their identities formed in my mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some horrible things happened to the characters in this book, but by and large their lives were not miserable. I’ve always had a hard time building a mental model of how many people are truly suffering all the time in the world. What is the distribution of sadness? Do some people suffer a lot? Do most people suffer a little? The world of The Interestings, it seems, consists of most people suffering a little. That could be naive, or wrong, but it’s one possible world. It’s a more hopeful world, but part of me fears it’s not exactly the world we live in.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Inside Out</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://letterboxd.com/samarthbhaskar/film/inside-out-2015/&quot;&gt;LetterboxD review link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly, let me share my excitement for Pixar’s triumphant return after a few duds. Inside Out immediately made it into the list of my favorite Pixar films including Toy Story, Wall-E, Ratatouille and Up! These films, over the last 20 (!) years have cemented Pixar as not only a stellar animation studio but one of the best moralist, cultural centers of art in existence today. There are few auteurs working today with as strong a central core and as wide an ambition as Pixar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some commentary on Pixar’s Inside Out suggests that this movie will forever change the way you think about how people think, or how you think about emotions. Inside Out isn’t grand enough to have that lasting of an effect. But while watching it, and maybe for a few hours afterward, you will be kinder to yourself. You’ll remember the power of your emotions and you’ll give yourself a break for not always being in control of them. That’s no small feat for a film to accomplish, and this film does it with aplomb.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Often films whose main conceit is the inner world draw a line between real life and what’s going on inside and have a hard time toeing that line. Inside Out not only strikes that balance well, it is enhanced by it. We are perpetually interested in Riley’s emotional well being because of what is going on in her real life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are times when Inside Out loses its way a bit. Starting with the main idea, the writers set out to unfold a story in chapters. Setting up this scaffolding was a smart structural decision. However, not every chapter in the story achieved the same payoff. With that said, arguably the chapter that matters the most, the ending, did. The turn toward “mixed emotions,” was well-earned, properly seeded throughout the story and not done in an over-the-top way. This was the right payoff for the risks the audience was asked to take, and it fit very well in the overall story constructed around the main idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sitting in a theater with toddlers, pre-teens, young-adults and parents was a great way to see this film. Everyone laughed throughout the film, at the same and different parts, for the same and different reasons. The film was preceded (at least at my showing) by a note of thanks from Pete Docter. I’ll bookend this review by thanking Docter and his team.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Hooper’s writing is lovely. She picked an aesthetic (fable-esque) and executed it well throughout the book. However, it never pulled me in completely. I always felt an arm’s length away from the emotional life Hooper built for Otto and Etta. I liked them both, and Russell and of course James - James is easy to love though. But I never felt like I had a stake in whatever happened to them next. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I often go on 4 or 5 hour runs or bike rides, so the meditative sense of flowing from past to present that characterized Etta’s walking was familiar. Hooper captured that state well. However, in the long list of walking books, I wouldn’t say this one is particularly memorable. It seems to capture the Canadian country side well (or at least what I imagine it must be like given my touchstone of Midwestern upbringing), which Hooper grew up in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suppose the first sentence of this review ultimately captures why I never really connected with this book. Fables have never really done it for me. I’m much more likely to get swept up in gritty ultra-realism rather than magical realism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I came to Beach Boys’ music in my teens. Somewhere in my childhood I’d heard the Beach Boys used to be popular, so I looked them up. I still listen to Pet Sounds, Sunflower and other albums with the same smile on my face. My adoration for their music is part of why this movie mattered to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I will say this film did Brian Wilson’s contributions to pop music history a lot of justice. Paul Dano brings great life to younger Wilson. His turns on screen, especially in the studio are some of my favorite parts of the movie. The strongest part of this film is the score and the history each of those famous Beach Boys songs carries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the film lacks a central momentum. The flashes back and forth are not flawed in and of themselves, they’re flawed because they lack a central conceit. Also it doesn’t help that John Cusack doesn’t care about anything anymore. (He and Cameron Crowe both were in the theater in the last week or two, but it seems years of money and success has left them limp, with no real zeal for anything anymore).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paul Giamatti, Elizabeth Banks and other talented supporting actors fall short of delivering strong performances largely because the only emotion we, as an audience, can feel toward Brian Wilson is pity. That doesn’t leave a lot of room for full, diverse depiction of emotions for the actors or the audience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PRO: This is a feminist action film. We need more of those.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CON: it is not billed as a feminist action film. That’s a bummer, because some people who might go see it probably won’t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PRO: the action sequences, car chases, world-building and relentless intensity set this film apart from most summer blockbusters. Miller has at once a grandness and precision that other films have a hard time achieving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CON: besides Theron’s Furiosa, there are few characters well-developed, little imagery injected, few questions probed in this film overall. The plot and characters generally seemed to be an after thought rather than a driving force in the movie. Hardy is given little chance to display his acting skills. That’s an opportunity lost, in my opinion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall: a fun summer ride, but I doubt it’ll be memorable for anyone who isn’t already part of the Burning Man crowd.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In the last 3 or 4 years, Coates has become my go-to source for deep, historically situated commentary on race in America. His contributions to the national conversation as a journalist and pubic figure are second to none right now, in my opinion. When he writes long, researched, hard-hitting pieces like The Case for Reparations or when he’s just penning a blog post about the latest Kendrick Lamar album, Coates has a singular talent in finding kernels of importance in how our country works. His vision of America is at once slicing and inspirational. He has never let America off easy for its many internal contradictions but he remains one of America’s biggest cheerleaders, proven by the relentless way in which he analyzes our country.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I came to this book with this background on Coates. I only knew him as he stands today, a writer and contributor to The Atlantic. An active blogger. A protege of David Carr. But reading about his childhood and upbringing brought me even more admiration for him. He was a total nerd, member of a socially conscious family, observant and thoughtful young man. His social struggles, the politics of his family and community, academic life - all shaped his world view. Fundamentally, TNC is a curious being. He is deeply interested in the world around him. This quality has served him well in building a unique world view. And, thankfully, we as his readers now benefit from this trait.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I have any complaints with this book, and there are very few I have, it is that there are times when the writing seems too caught up in TNC’s own head. His brain works in particular ways and it’s not always easy for the reader to follow along when lines of thought aren’t connected back to reality for the reader.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Selfish, Shallow, and Self-Absorbed - Sixteen Writers on The Decision Not To Have Kids</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I don’t think I learned too many new things by reading this book, but it was a good exercise in building empathy for people who decide not to have children. I don’t really know where I stand on this, and being a man, maybe it’ll be a decision I’ll never really have to make. It certainly won’t be a decision that’ll mean the same thing to me as perhaps my future wife or partner. But none the less, it was important for me to read this book and I’m glad I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe one reason I feel like I didn’t really get anything deep and true out of this book is because the decision to or not to have kids isn’t some huge, moralistic thing. Consequently, expecting some big moralistic truths to come out of a discussion not entirely tied to moral categories makes little sense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could’ve done with a little less “I don’t want children…but I love them!” as a defense against having children. It’s too bad that someone’s ability to be loving and caring is brought into question just because they don’t want children.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Dr. Sacks came into my life only the last few years. I believe I was introduced to him either via Radiolab or one of Jonah Lehrer’s pop-science books. But almost as soon as I became aware of him, I was enchanted by him. His soft tone of voice, his ability to build and convey beautiful narratives based on concepts in neuroscience and his explorations of topics far and wide like music, degenerative disorders, biological underpinning of social fabric and more were all part of my initial and continued interest in his work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the time of this introduction, I was developing a budding interest in neuroscience. Although my interest never really surpassed hobbyist levels, I credit Dr. Sacks for getting me up to speed on concepts and topics in this area. My interest is always piqued when Dr. Sacks’ voice comes across my radar - whether in an article, a book, a YouTube clip or a Radiolab segment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before reading this book, I knew little about his life. I knew about some of this neurological disorders he suffered from. Then, a few months ago, Dr. Sacks penned an op-ed in the Times about his cancer diagnosis and end-of-life outlook. I was moved when I read it. I shared and discussed it with friends. His approach to death, much like his approach to life, was marked by beautiful story telling. In just a few hundred words he crafted a remarkable approach to how he would spend his final days looking back on his life and preparing for its end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I arrived at this book as an interested party. Much like his other works, Dr. Sacks created a beautiful narrative in this book. I was happy to be along for the journey as he recounted stories and vignettes from his storied life. I was saddened when he talked about his abusive past, about going without love or sex for 35 years. I don’t think he ever meant to portray himself in a sad light, but that’s the reaction it espoused from me. I was fascinated to read about how deeply and fully he threw himself into so many things. From motorcycling, to power lifting, to medicine, to drugs, travel, friendships, his family. The depth of his experience in each of these areas is what I found most admirable. Anyone can pick up a new topic or a new passion for a month or year; but long-lasting, sustained commitment is rare and special.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ultimately, that’s what I will remember Dr. Sacks for. His deep and thorough commitment to understanding everything he could about the topics he was passionate about. And secondly, how he shared all he learned with the world in a way that anyone could relate to. I consider these chief among plethora achievements in his life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t know too much about Nick Kroll but I’ve seen some of his work in the Kroll Show and The League. I’m also largely unfamiliar with the Duplass brothers, but I know their work a bit better. Of their work I’ve seen so far, this ranks near the bottom for me. It felt like the whole cast had been infected by Kroll’s too-cool-to-care attitude. It also didn’t help that the cast wasn’t given much of a script to build from. Sometimes scripts give the sense that just a few more rounds of edits and they could’ve been shaped into something better. This script was not even close to that. This script needed a few new ideas, maybe a few new characters, and a whole different plot to make it any better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As far as documentaries go, this wasn’t all that special. But as far as public intellectuals go, Howard Zinn was singular. A Marxian historian, who somehow penetrated public consciousness year after year, writing seminal popular works, producing high quality academic literature, and participating in all the major issues of his time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before this documentary, most of my knowledge about Zinn came from his famous work A People’s History. I didn’t know about his background at Spellman college in the 60s, his participation in anti-war protests in Vietnam, or his activism in the 80s and 90s. I’m glad this documentary captured his time as a public figure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Saw this over the weekend at MoMA screening. It was a nice change of venue that elevated this already stratospheric film. I don’t think I can write about this film critically, mostly because I just enjoyed it so much. And also because I don’t think I can find much wrong about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also liked watching this after joining the iconic journalistic enterprise of my time. It brought the film down to earth, for me. Journalism, at least how it is practiced now, is a pretty uniquely American endeavor and Kane captures the aspirations and faults of the industry quite well.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Doer’s novel sets its aims high and achieves some impressive technical and formal goals. All the praise it has received from critics is largely backed up upon reading. In fact, every time I read a critique or a commentary on the novel, I end up thinking I liked it a lot. Doer flows back and forth between characters with ease. He moves the story through time, a fraught time at that, beautifully. He has thought up some really impressive characters, especially Marie-Laure. His usage of objects and imagery, especially leading blind readers through the world of a blind protagonist is well done. He even used one of my favorite books, Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea, as a focal point. He even had a bunch of math and physics, usually subjects that get me excited when they’re written about masterfully without being dumbed down. All of these things are to be praised. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the truth is, the book just didn’t resonate with me. Somehow, the book fell shorter than the sum of its parts. Werner, von Rumpel, Jutta and some of the characters on that half of the story’s world were not built with bright enough emotional lives for me to feel empathy for them. Marie-Laure, and her family, although interesting felt entirely saccharine and without complications. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suppose this happens sometimes in life, everything is executed properly, comes together nicely but it leaves us wanting for something more. I know some people felt this way last year when the Spurs won the NBA championship. There are years when films win Academy Awards because of their perfect execution, while others with more heart go unnoticed. Heart, frustratingly for many creators, is just either there or not there. For me, there was little to no heart in this book.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>A Marxian reading of Technology</title>
   <link href="/blog/marxian_reading_of_technology/"/>
   <updated>2015-04-13T00:00:00-04:00</updated>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Tonight I attended my first meeting of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jacobinmag.com/&quot;&gt;Jacobin Magazine&lt;/a&gt; reading group. Jacobin Magazine is a leading leftist magazine, providing cultural, social and political commentary from a polemical leftist perspective. The reading group meets once a month in Brooklyn and provides a semi-structured conversation for readers of the magazine. This month’s topic was technology. And tonight’s readings were &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jacobinmag.com/2015/04/braverman-gramsci-marx-technology/&quot;&gt;Technology and Socialist Strategy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jacobinmag.com/2015/03/socialism-innovation-capitalism-smith/&quot;&gt;Red Innovation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jacobinmag.com/2015/03/socialism-innovation-capitalism-smith/&quot;&gt;Red Innovation&lt;/a&gt; dealt with some of the anxieties the labor force currently faces, about being automated out of a job. It brought context to this topic by discussing the history of government investment in research and development, society’s role in intellectual property rights and generally proposing a social structure that would encourage innovation without realizing some of the anxieties of de-skilling, greater unemployment or increased inequality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jacobinmag.com/2015/04/braverman-gramsci-marx-technology/&quot;&gt;Technology and Socialist Strategy&lt;/a&gt; dealt with the topic of technology in a slightly different way. It brought to bear different strands of Marxian theory. From discussing Marx’s approach to technology (he was generally impressed with technology, but saw clear, inherent class based problems), to Gramsci’s Fordist romance, to the late-century English labor movements - this article was a much more textured look at technology’s role in labor force and social development. One of the main lessons I took from it, and from the discussion tonight, was that any technology reflects the system in which it was built. The technologies we live with today, and the anxieties they provoke, are inherently tied to the system in which they were produced. Conversely, technologies produced in a post-capitalist system might look, feel, perform completely differently. A question that could follow from this is - will new, completely different technologies possibly usher in post-capitalism? Or does the causal arrow only flow one way?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the discussions tonight, especially about technology’s role in government reminded me a lot of the general &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thebaffler.com/salvos/the-meme-hustler&quot;&gt;O’Reilly&lt;/a&gt; premise that with enough smart, efficient technology, government services can benefit everyone. This is generally a well accepted premise, and government’s not so secret love affair with technology is something we should look at critically. The same government that monitors our use of the internet, or phones, or deploys drones across the world to “accomplish goals in our national interest,” can easily be painted as a neutral, benevolent purveyor of technological efficiency for its citizens (cutting wait times at the DMV with an app, for example).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m far from a technophobe, but I also don’t view technology as a neutral, value-less force. Technology carries values, and we should be careful when we promote one technology over another or technology writ-large over no technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“What does it feel like to have created something that hates you?” This is a question Ava asks of Nathan, her creator. A poignant and thoughtful question to ask of a creator indeed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ex Machina has some great qualities working in its favor. Beautiful photography and cinematic scapes of Norway. Well executed references to mythology, history, nature vs. nurture debates seamlessly included in dialog. It is well situated among the genre’s many explorations of AI as a topic - man made intelligence, replication of human emotions, capacity for love, machine and man relations. It is very clear the film-maker is a writer. From his dual reliance on dialog and setting, rather than cinematic tools like movement, frame, motion. To the structure of the film, basically unfolding in chapters but well-paced, properly revealed chapters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But at the same time, Ex Machina lacks some qualities that keep it from going from an “I like it” to an “I love it” film. Chief among these is its inability to offer something new to the topic of AI. There were hardly any new sci-fi concepts that I came away with. Or any explorations of old sci-fi concepts that made me consider Alex Garland an influential voice for the genre. In fact, his adherence to earthly conceptualizations of gender, sexuality and power made me wonder if he’s even the right guy to be shaping our future. That probably sounds harsher than its meant to, but I could’ve done with some injection of feminism here.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;David Carr was a man who left an impression. I never met him, but he has left an impression on me. I recently started working at the New York Times, in the newsroom. He passed away in my second week there. It was abundantly clear that he left an impression on scores of people there. His descriptions of the place so far match my take on it. There’s an unspoken agreement around the newsroom that everyone will constantly try to make the Times a better institution. David Carr seemed to embody some of that same spirit. Maybe he didn’t grow into it until the second half of his life, but he wanted deeply engage with things. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Carr’s descriptions of New York also match my take on the city. “The trick of enjoying New York is to not be so busy grinding your way to the center of the earth that you fail to notice the sparkle of the place, a scale and a kind of wonder that put all human endeavors in their proper place.” I’ve tried my best to build my life in New York in this way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Besides these commonalities - our backgrounds as Midwesterners (he born, I adopted), New York City, the Times, among others - Carr’s writing and life grabbed me in other ways too. There’s nothing about him that comes off as distantly genius. Instead, he might be described as earthly genius. The intellect, the insight, the wisdom all seems not god-given but attained through experience, thoughtful meditation and a refusal to settle on any simple answer. This is most clearly embodied in his choice to thoroughly vet and document his memories via interviews and document analysis. Carr put in sweat and tears to construct this memoir. He put in sweat and tears to become one of the world’s leading technology and media columnists. He put in sweat and tears to mentor a future generation of world-class journalists like Brian Stelter and Tanehisi Coates. Nothing about his life seemed gifted, everything was a grind. I find myself feeling that way at times. Don’t get me wrong, I’ve been blessed in more ways than I can count, but I would describe myself as having average cognitive ability. Whatever intelligence, wisdom, knowledge, creativity I can muster, all feels like the result of a grind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps, that’s what all true intelligence, knowledge, creativity, wisdom really is. Pulled out of a quicksand that would rather swallow it into darkness. Perhaps some people just make it seem like they divine their knowledge from the gods. If that is the case, I’m thankful that Carr did both - he muscled through the knowledge and then he made it clear that his peers and followers can do the same if we commit to the grind too. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I could take exception with anything about this book, it would be the structure of the chapters. They were too short and abrupt. Clearly written by a journalist who spent years writing and editing in newspaper formats. Books, to state the obvious, are a different medium from newspapers and require a different structure.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Furious 7</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://letterboxd.com/samarthbhaskar/film/furious-7/&quot;&gt;LetterboxD review link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Look, I’ll be honest. I’m in a place in life where I can’t really get into action movies like I used to when I was younger. For me, intellectual and emotional films carry more weight and grab my attention. With that out of the way, let’s see if I’m capable of writing about an action film for what it is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furious Seven accomplished a few things very well. The top of that list is the homage paid to Paul Walker at the end. The theater I was in went from hooting and hollering after the final action sequence to pin drop silence and audible sniffles. The director connected the world he created on screen to our real world seamlessly in giving tribute to a member of both of those worlds in a respectful way. I was impressed with that, to be sure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other thing it accomplished well was to be an action film of and about the times. The multiple sources of threat in the movie are all a mash up of current American anxieties. I’d have to go back to check, but I don’t think the other films in the series were as rooted in present day American zeitgeist as this. Drones, over-reaching surveillance systems, Middle Eastern/foreign bad guys with endless wealth and means – it was all present. Oddly enough, in spite of the fact that these anxieties are often tied to or born of the American government, in this film, the American government turns out to be an ally. I couldn’t quite figure out why this film, on the heels of many in recent years that have villainized the government, chose to be buddies. It was fresh if nothing else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other interesting thing for me, related to this last point, was that action movies in the last decade have become engines of global culture. Hollywood depends on action movies to feature little story, minimal dialog, transferable plot lines so that they can release these films around the world without much translation and increase potential earnings by orders of magnitude. James Wan, the Malaysian born director of Furious Seven and other global hits like Saw knows this. So maybe instead of calling Furious Seven patently American, we might rather call it patently global. Global culture is still being formed, it has been around for some time, but spread unevenly (as the quote about the future goes). I, for one, am sad that it seems to be inheriting American love for excess. There are other action films, Pacific Rim comes to mind, that are also part of this global culture, but they somehow eschew American excess in favor of something new. Furious Seven didn’t do that, and didn’t care to. I hope global culture, whenever it is more shaped, has something new to offer, not just more of this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What can be said about this film that hasn’t been said already by learned critics and fanboys alike? The characters, the pacing and plotting, casting, dialogue, melding of film genres, overall commentary on the times; really everything congeals together so well in this film. As Ebert once said, “the details need not concern us.” This film is as much about the attitude as about the facts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Coens bring eastern philosophy, biting political commentary, astute observations about modern America and fully formed philosophical approaches to life into this film. Any lesser filmmaker would’ve seen that list of things and tried to accomplish one. Any lesser filmmaker would’ve been unable to take that list of things and keep the audience entertained the whole time. The Coens took it all and kept it hilarious and entertaining throughout. I had a smile on my face throughout and more than a few laughs out loud.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have held and will continue to hold that Julianne Moore is among the top-3 best actors working today. After listening to a recent Here’s The Thing interview with her, and learning that she never really planned to have this illustrious of a career and instead tried to find new, interesting and challenging work, I’m convinced that is the only true way to succeed in life. I can think of maybe a handful of people who planned and executed their paths to success. Almost everyone else who succeeded, got to it by trying everything else first.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Economics after the Crash - A Discipline in Need of Renewal?</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Part 2&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A couple of weeks ago, the New York Review of Books Foundation held a conference about economics. The title of the conference was “What’s Wrong with the Economy and with Economics?” The conference featured academics and public intellectuals giving short talks and engaging in debates about modern day macro-economic trends. All the videos from the conference are available on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nybooks.com/blogs/gallery/2015/mar/29/whats-wrong-with-the-economy/&quot;&gt;NYRB&lt;/a&gt; site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next &lt;a href=&quot;https://vimeo.com/122574224&quot;&gt;video&lt;/a&gt; from the NYRB conference I watched featured one of the most prominent economist/public intellectuals of the day, Paul Krugman. Along with Benjamin Friedman of Harvard and Lord Skidelsky of the University of Warwick and House of Lords, this panel primarily addressed the question of economics and economists in the last 7 years since the financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All three panelists did a great job of digging into some of the assumptions and biases in economics that keep it from being a true science and from advancing the public’s understanding of the role of money, power and value in society. From age-old criticisms like econ’s inability to conduct true causal analysis, to its over-reliance on mathematical models, to the complete inability of economics to understand and model power, the talks and discussion were very fascinating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was clear, to me, that Krugman’s years as an Op-Ed writer have served him well in developing his ability to construct arguments using analogies, kitchy turns of phrase and emotionally grounded appeals that make him far more effective in this type of forum than his contemporaries. I’m sure some, more technical, watchers of the field might see that as a detriment to his role as an economist (don’t forget though, that he won a Clark and a Nobel in the field) but I find it an asset that the field could do more with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, a really strong discussion, featuring some very salient points and worth the time it took to watch it.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Going Clear Scientology and the Prison of Belief</title>

&lt;p&gt;A couple of things. Firstly, I just can’t get animated about a bunch of rich, white people aspiring to deeper, more meaningful lives by looking to the afterlife. Instead of feeling unfulfilled, listless and broken then turning to the world and helping people around them for meaning, they turn to science fiction? Yawn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The abuse in the film is real and not to be overlooked. But there is worse and more rampant abuse that gets little to none of the same empathy. What’s worse is that the other kind of abuse is state and society sanctioned. I have a hard time pitying people who throw their lot in with a cult. I’m more enraged on behalf of people who are structurally and repetitively abused by huge, inescapable institutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, on a doc level, I thought the film was lazy. It really let L Ron Hubbard off the hook. When he flees the country they just say he went to “parts unknown.” No serious documentarian would allow that in his film. They also glossed over so many details about his military service, his lies about his military record and injuries, his domestic abuse history. The fact that all this was just accepted wholesale by his followers and contemporaries is what is interesting. Imagine a non-white man getting away with any of this. It’s impossible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And if you don’t want to make this about race (why not by the way?), then some exploration about the context in which all this leeway was afforded to Hubbard is worthwhile. What was about it about America in the 1950s that allowed Dianetics to become and stay popular?&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>The Problem of Value - Economics as a Moral Science</title>

&lt;p&gt;I started by watching a panel on The Problem of Value: Economics as a Moral Science. This &lt;a href=&quot;https://vimeo.com/122591452&quot;&gt;video&lt;/a&gt; features a panel moderated by Itamar Rabinovich, with talks by Greta Brochmann from the University of Oslo, Richard Sennett of NYU and Jeremy Waldron also of NYU. Each speaker gave a short talk on their interpretation of the place of “value” in economic analysis. They all had different takes on the topic, but each I enjoyed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I liked Brochmann’s talk the best because it presented the most concise and comprehensive review of Scandinavian welfare societies I’ve ever come across. She had a great model to present about how the Scandinavian model came to be. What values from its past it incorporated, how it is being challenged in modern day Norway, Sweden, etc and the onset of immigration and their new relationship with the EU. Her approach to this question was much more tactical and micro-econ based, but I think it made the strongest case for the inclusion of moralistic frameworks in econ policy by the state. Econ is often characterized as a faceless, emotionless, humanity-less science - but if framed properly it can be undeniably human, touching every part of the human experience in modern society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Richard Sennett’s talk was also interesting but for a different reason. He focused on the effect of new economic forces on young people’s valuation and formation of a career and life. This is a particularly pertinent topic for me, at the start of my career. And although I agree with him that things are very different now than they have been ever before (for new members of the workforce), I didn’t come away with some new understanding of how economics was going to help address these changes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I look forward to checking out some of the other panels in the next few days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m just not a horror movie guy. I just can’t do it. Albeit through shaded eyes, white-knuckling arm rests, repeating mantras to myself (“its not real, its not real”), I ended up sort of enjoying It Follows. Although, if I’m being honest about it as a film, in conversation with other films released this year, it is high on style and middling on subject.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It Follows elevates its genre, although admittedly I know little about the genre and would believe you if you told me it doesn’t care to be elevated. Some acting performances stand out from others, but overall everyone put in about a college-level performance. The only exception is the director, David Robert Mitchell. Mitchell has a great eye for photography, uses light very well, and constructs some pretty good scenes from what I can imagine was not all that instructive or inspiring of a script.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After seeing Cabin in the Woods a few years ago and enjoying it, I thought I’d give this a chance. I’m glad I saw it. Now I can wait another 2-5 years before seeing my next horror film.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>While We're Young</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://letterboxd.com/samarthbhaskar/film/while-were-young/&quot;&gt;LetterboxD review link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Noah Baumbach’s follow up to Frances Ha starts its first act with some of the same frenetic energy, Brooklyn landscapes and locomotive promise as Frances Ha. It’s relationship to Greenberg is also apparent as soon as we meet Ben Stiller’s protagonist. However, unlike these earlier films, the payoff in While We’re Young is not nearly as handsome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main conceit of this film is some sort of battle of the generations. It is clear that Mr. Baumbach is feeling the influence of father time. Portraying a film-maker, fighting time, stretching and contorting to fit into a changing world is his way of dealing with it. Baumbach features the “greatest generation,” in his own generation X and in the millennial generation. The first he treats with respect and reverence. The second he feels has never lived up to its potential, and may never get the same sense of satisfaction that its predecessor had. The last, unfortunately, he treats with the same unimaginative, curmudgeonly outlook that you’d find in some hack periodical article from anytime in the last 10 years. Millennials are entitled, constantly searching for authenticity but can’t define authenticity, aren’t governed by coherent morals or ethics or are threatening to take culture down the toilet with them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my estimation, this whole exercise of defining generations, assigning them characteristics or descriptors seems sort of futile. No generation besides Stiller’s father-in-law’s is treated with deference. And even then, its largely without nuance. This is the same generation that is called “the greatest,” who at once defeated the Nazis and perpetrated decades of civil rights violations against its own members. Generation X was basically set up for failure because they could never live up to the standard of winning a world war or ushering in orders of magnitude worth of increases in standards of living. Millennials are barely getting into power and are already being asked “what have you done for our country yet?” In the last shot of the film (before Stiller and Watts go to Haiti to adopt a baby, a problematic appropriation unto itself), they are already casting aspersions on a baby. Imagining all the ways in which this newest generation will disappoint them. So if no one can really live up to these expectations, what is the point of creating them? Maybe let’s just give each other the space and support to figure it out as we go along. And realize there aren’t really lines between us. We’re all just figuring it out together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To this end, I loved that Ad-Rock played a tired, loving, dad in this film. If there’s any way to signify that everyone changes, and each of us have our time to be young and time to be old - it is to take a Beastie Boy and put a cloth baby bjorn on him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is very clear that this is a film written and directed by a white man. The women in this film are supporting characters, only showing up when they can support men in their endeavors, no ambitions of their own. And you know what else white men love? Finding something to blame. Whether its their own membership in a listless generation, or some generation before or after them. Someone’s gotta be at fault for things not going so well, and it’s hardly ever themselves or just how things worked out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cinematic narcissists are pretty common. It’s easy to revert to writing about and directing a character obsessed with himself (and it is often a him) because of the nature of film as a medium. The audience buys a ticket, sits in a chair, gives you 2 hours of their attention, expects to connect to something and hopes to walk away at the end with a new thought. Doing this by creating a character so involved with himself that you can fully explore, at least, one person is a pretty sensible thing to do. I also, unfortunately, find it sort of lazy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If it weren’t for the cover-art, I don’t think I would’ve compared Listen Up Philip to Harold and Maude, but the comparison is not too far fetched. Harold is a narcissist if there ever was one. Obsessed with his own death. Philip is a narcissist, but instead of being obsessed with his own death, he’s obsessed with more earthly things. Fame, respect, status, among others. Despite the fact that death is a boring subject, Harold is endearing, charming and lovable. Philip is not. That could also be my aversion to Jason Schwartzman speaking. (I’m a fan of Wes Anderson’s films, despite his insistence on casting Schwartzman everywhere).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Listen Up Philip is saved, however, by Elizabeth Moss. Moss seems to be saving a lot of projects of late. Which, I suppose, is a real testament to her acting, intellect, ability to find something meaningful to share about each character she’s handed.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Some review, either here on Goodreads or elsewhere, likened this book to a magic trick. That seems about right to me. I have no idea how Offill pulled this off, but she did it. And unlike some other magic tricks, I don’t particularly care to know how it all happened. I’m just happy to have been a witness to it. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Offill, and her protagonist, have a skill that I’ve always wanted. She remembers pithy quotes and sentences from instructive authors and books. I read a lot and I remember a lot of the main themes and theories I come across, but those quotes and sentences that sum everything up nicely - they don’t stick in my brain the way they do in Offill’s. It’s a trait I admire and envy. Those were probably my favorite part of the whole book. Because, like many a millennial, I ascribe authority to someone who can bring in a lot of view-points. If you’re quoting literary giants, Russian authors, philosophers, artists, your predecessors, you’re placing yourself in the historical perspective - I tend to believe you know more what you’re talking about than some others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What kept me from giving this 5/5 stars was primarily that it was too pithy for its own good. Although I felt connected to The Wife, and very much appreciated the journey she went through as a single woman, wife, new mother, cheated-upon wife, victim, healer, healed, etc etc - I would’ve been more impressed with Offill if she could’ve built a bigger world around this journey. We never left The Wife’s mind, and although there was plenty in there to be caught up with, I would’ve loved to see more of the world around her.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I found an early-release copy of this lying around a book review desk at work, read the blurb on the back and picked it up. There was nothing especially compelling about the premise, but a free book, hey, why not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pelzman’s background as student of Russian literature is pretty clear in how he chooses to portray the main male protagonist in this novel. A man defined by hardship, heir to the throne of courage and valor, and someone who keeps his closest friends/loved ones at arms distance is about as Russian hero as you can get. But situating this man in an American context, relating to a Cuban stripper (a pretty wrought allegory about Russian/Cuban relations, but whatever), is a novel way of exploring this character.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was happy to see that Pelzman tried out new things throughout the book. Switching from third-person to first-person, changing perspectives throughout his short chapters, giving each main character a chance to tell the story from his/her own eye. That kept me interested in the second half of the book.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, ultimately, this was a book about one main idea. About the odd, but oddly not that unbelievable, relationship between Sophie, Julian and Perla. I was hoping Pelzman would come up with something deeper to say about this relationship but he seemed to just stop right there. Almost as if it to say “hey look, isn’t this a weird relationship?” which isn’t enough to really make for a memorable book.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This book is very much of its time. Although it is obsessed with a universal and timeless topic: death, it hardly felt universal or timeless. This is book is particularly American, particularly modern, particularly rich, particularly white, particularly cerebral, particularly . . . well you get the point. Having said that, although it is very clearly situated in a specific time and place, it gets a lot of things right about that time and place. Written in 1985, White Noise’s descriptions of families, relationships between listless people and their professions, descriptions about Americans’ obsessions, American life are all pretty applicable to today. This last sentence might sound like it contradicts the one before it, but I don’t think this book would describe an America 20 years before it or America 20 years from now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Delillo is funny. In much the way David Foster Wallace is funny, or Jonathan Franzen is funny. But unlike DFW, Franzen and other contemporaries of Delillo, I wished he wasn’t so obsessed with death. What is death, anyway, its just something that happens at the end of life. There’s so much other stuff going on in life to obsess over.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Let me join the chorus of people claiming this as their favorite book of 2015. There’s a very strong case to be made for that claim, and its only March. I flew through this 700+ page book in 3 short nights, including a cross-country flight. It is a page-turner in the most literary sense. Yanagihara maintained suspense and interest with virtuosic precision. Every time I felt like some resolution was coming my way, she changed perspective, told a different story, revealed another layer in a different corner of Jude’s life. My last few favorite reads have all been 6-700 page works (Goldfinch, Fourth of July Creek, A Little Life) which is making me consider the idea that literature, as a medium, needs that sort of space to truly achieve its goal. That’s a pretty strong challenge to most contemporary novels that try and achieve their goals in 300 pages or less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This idea is something I was thinking a lot about about watching Selma. Ava Duvernay chose, arguably the right choice, to only depict a small chunk of MLK’s life and the civil rights struggle. Juxtaposed to Spike Lee, whose comparable project Malcolm X featured almost the entirety of its protagonist’s life. I suppose that’s really the answer then, either you go all in and make a 3+ hour movie, or write 700 pages. Or you choose a small sliver and give it proper treatment. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, back to the book. The thing is, I know people like Jude. Not people who’ve been through as much as he has. But people who are broken. People who can’t ask for what they need. People who don’t even know what they need. I might be betraying myself in writing this as a member of this group. Jude is an extreme example of this. But the big difference between Jude and most people I know who struggle with depression, anxiety, abuse, sordid pasts is that they aren’t as silent as Jude was. For 30 years he let no one in. He let Andy in a little. He let Harold in even less. Even when he was committed, to letting Willem in, he didn’t completely. I don’t blame Jude for this. I couldn’t. I think Jude never saw what was at the end of those conversations. After sharing his stories, he would’ve opened up a new space for himself. To come across new ways of living, new ways of framing his past. As long as those memories stayed inside him, they were never going to take new shape. If he had taken the chance, let those memories out, they may have been reshaped, and he may have found a new life for himself. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a warning to be heeded. Make no mistake, silence, bottling up your feelings, keeping your past to yourself (for whatever fear - burdening others, fear of judgment, fear of being ostracized) will kill you. In fact, the only thing I’ve seen that has as much power as the evils people are victim to, is talking, sharing, and asking for help. That’s the ultimate bravery. It’s not possible for everyone, but its the only thing I know that works. I wished, I so wished Jude would’ve found it. He got close, but he never did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s hard to pull off a strict play like this in a film medium. Tommy Lee Jones didn’t try to flower it up as a director. He also played it pretty close to the chest as an actor. Sam Jackson, on the other hand, took it a little further with his acting. Although, subtlety and challenging mainstream conceptualizations of black men, is not Sam Jackson’s strong suit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Sunset Limited showcases Cormack McCarthy’s genius ability to take on deep, meaningful topics (like God, good and evil, jealousy, corruption, greed) and treat them in hyper personal ways. McCarthy’s work has been adapted for the screen a few times now, but it took an equally strong cinematic voice (the Coen Brothers) to pull it off successfully in No Country for Old Men. Lesser directors like Ridley Scott, Tom Hillcoat and James Franco weren’t able to adapt his words for the screen as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Sunset Limited is a good progression of play adaptations, but earlier attempts like Waiting for Godot and Lumet’s 12 Angry Men were bigger achievements in adapting a stage play for the screen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This film probably wouldn’t have crossed my radar if not for Filmspotting, but I don’t think I loved it as much as Josh, Adam and others. I got into the lead actor. I can look past the loose ends in writing and editing. I could even give it a pass for the lack of plotting, ambition or structure. But to be any more forgiving would be to fall prey to exactly the kind of unearned forgiveness the protagonist receives throughout the whole film.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I had to pick a tagline, it would probably be something like “being a white guy, amirite?”&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Kendrick Lamar - To Pimp a Butterfly</title>
   <link href="/blog/kendrick-lamar-to-pimp-a-butterfly/"/>
   <updated>2015-03-17T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/kendrick-lamar-to-pimp-a-butterfly</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Earlier this week, Kendrick Lamar released his much anticipated and long-awaited follow up to “good kid, m.A.A.d city,” called “To Pimp a Butterfly.” The album has been showered with early praise. Lamar has done a few interviews, including this one in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/22/arts/music/kendrick-lamar-on-his-new-album-and-the-weight-of-clarity.html?_r=0&amp;amp;pagewanted=all&quot;&gt;New York Times&lt;/a&gt; that situates him among “prophetic witnesses” like Sam Cooke, Marvin Gaye, and Curtis Mayfield.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve listened to the album a handful of times in the last couple of days and it has yet to lose its effect. Albums (or films, or books, or really anything) that are highly anticipated often don’t live up to the hype. There have been only a few moments in the last few years when something I have high expectations for ends up meeting and surpassing those expectations. After whetting my appetite earlier this year with “Blacker the Berry” and “Untitled” (performed only on &lt;a href=&quot;http://thecolbertreport.cc.com/videos/pjrqsj/kendrick-lamar&quot;&gt;Colbert Report&lt;/a&gt;), Lamar has accomplished a rare and difficult feat; his album has met and surpassed high expectations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aesthetically, the album delivers. Lamar invites legends like George Clinton, flows over beats by Flying Lotus, invites sublime singers like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SJIgTLe0hc&quot;&gt;Lalah Hathaway&lt;/a&gt;, samples Sufjan Stevens and brings in some of the best jazz riffs I’ve heard in hip hop in a while. The album is well-balanced, it ebbs and flows to keep your attention but doesn’t seem to compromise in production quality. Each track stands well on its own but is elevated as an ensemble album.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But that is only the honey with which Lamar attracts the listener. Behind this beautiful music is the story of Kendrick Lamar in the last few years. His battles with depression, survivor’s guilt, success, fame and the strong weight of responsibility as he has become more famous and more powerful. Lamar is the post-modern artist we’ve been blessed with. Like James Baldwin in his time, Lamar struggles out loud with the contradictions in his life. With his inability to draw a clear narrative arc through his upbringing in Compton and now his new found success as an internationally touring artist. And like Baldwin, and Langston Hughes and other worthy comparisons, Lamar expresses all of these feelings in his poetry. And like those predecessors, Lamar isn’t interested in distancing himself from his upbringing, even though his life now couldn’t be any more different. Lamar is trying, with all his might, to take what he’s been given, think and write critically about what that means for him, for his community, and come up with some answers about how he can bring all this back together. The prophetic preachers of soul and hip hop’s past have been fighting this battle from the pulpit of fame for generations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This album has signs of maturity that were not present in “good kid, m.A.A.d city.” If that album was a day in the life of 25 year old Lamar, this album is deeper look at a young adult coming to terms with growing up. He struggles, at once, with being a hypocrite, but also needing to build self-confidence to survive in a competitive world. These struggles are not too different from what Kanye West has been going through in recent years. But Kanye’s resolution has been different. His focus has been on high art and on high culture. Kendrick, on the other hand, is squarely situated in popular culture. For my money, I’d much rather hear a man describe his struggle for meaning in every day life than trying to find meaning in some higher, more philosophical milieu.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do this thing, when I write about movies, where I have to find some meaning or commentary to write about. I’m going to try not to do that here, because that would be a disservice to this movie. If this movie is in conversation with anything social or current, its our cultural moment with vampires. And maybe with mockumentaries as a genre. That’s about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite that, or maybe because of it, it is also one of the funniest movies I’ve seen in 2015. It takes a silly premise, a bunch of vampire flatmates deal with a fish-out-of-water new vampire, and keeps the jokes coming. There was a moment when I thought, oh no, they’re going to run out of jokes, but almost immediately after that the word “swearwolves” was uttered and I was proven wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only Lovers Left Alive attempted this same thing, to elevate vampire stories into something more interesting than Twilight. They accomplished that goal, and then same. What We Do in the Shadows does the same, with aplomb.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If a white man toured with the Rolling Stones, non-stop, since 1982, more than half the tenure of the band in total - would he not be considered a member of the band? I’m hard pressed to think of a case when that wouldn’t be true. But Lisa Fischer, a black woman, described as ego-free or “not having that kind of ambition” is never given that same treatment. There are a lot of gender and race politics going on in this film, but unfortunately I don’t think the film-makers quite have a grasp on what to say about them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s one thing to point out a clear and present gender disparity (which they have). It’s a whole another thing to say something meaningful about it (which they don’t quite accomplish).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite that glaring failure, this film has some of the best documentary sequences, direct-to-camera interviews and live performance footage of truly sublime singing. I don’t think it should’ve taken the academy away from The Act of Killing or maybe even overshadowed Stories We Tell in its cohort, but that’s not to say the film doesn’t deserve some accolades. The topic is great. The characters are great. I wish some more able filmmakers had given it an attempt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apropos - I happened to listen to this podcast the same night I saw this film. Fortuitous because I loved learning about Lisa Fischer – http://www.wnyc.org/story/lisa-fischer-death-sex-money/&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Knausgaard on immigration</title>

   <id>/blog/knausgaard-on-immigration</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/15/magazine/karl-ove-knausgaards-passage-through-america.html?hp&amp;amp;action=click&amp;amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;amp;module=second-column-region&amp;amp;region=top-news&amp;amp;WT.nav=top-news&amp;amp;_r=1&amp;amp;pagewanted=all&quot;&gt;part 2&lt;/a&gt; of Karl Ove Knausgaard’s NYTimes magazine feature, the author - most famously of a 6-part &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Struggle_%28Knausg%C3%A5rd_novels%29&quot;&gt;memoir&lt;/a&gt; - writes about immigration. His assignment has been to trace the paths that Vikings and early Norwegians took in America, first arriving in Newfoundland and then settling in mainland America.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Karl Ove is still uncomfortable in America. He’s still unsure what to even make of his journey. But one thing is clear, his time in America is going to be spent as a Norwegian and will most likely be limited. That emotional distance allows him to think critically about American culture and American emigration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This definition of culture, especially in the context of an American immigrant trying to assimilate, rung very true for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;What is culture, if not a set of prejudices? A set of unformulated and unconscious rules and ways of behavior that every member of a given society nonetheless immediately recognizes and accepts?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Karl Ove is thinking of and writing about his ancestors and older family members settling here. This is exactly the kind of cultural shift I went through as an immigrant. In fact, my family and I ended up at the end of that transition absorbing all manner of American prejudices, a lot of which were targeted right back at Indian-American immigrants. That’s something about immigrant communities I have never understood - how quick we are to put down other immigrants behind us in the assimilation process. What a shame, that we can’t extend courtesy and comfort to our compatriots, the same that we were denied merely a few years before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kate Lyn Sheil floats this movie into the place that, I presume, the writers wanted it to be. There are a lot of times, where actresses with lesser command over the material would’ve fallen into traps. They might’ve downplayed the character’s sadness. They might’ve relied on dialogue to convey more than the acting. But in many moments Sheil let’s her face and her emotionality take the wheel, and that’s probably the movie’s best reward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lesser parts of this movie are, well, basically everything else. The script strays too far from convention, but not in a compelling, artistic way, more in an annoying, rebellious for the sake of being rebellious way. I suppose, in some ways, it strays from convention in much the same way that hipsters stray from convention. Both, without their proper motivation thought through, are annoying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of, if not the singular, best sequels of all time. Very few movie franchises can pick up where film 1 left off and take film 2 into a better place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I grew up on this and films like this. I was home sick today so I went back to it for comfort. It’s weird to find comfort in 2 hour action packed 90s films, but well, here I am.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a guilty pleasure favorite for me. It’s not an art-house film. It treats women like crap. There might literally be 0 non-white people in it. It has a cheesy soundtrack that swells my emotions. It was one of the first films that endeared me to Ed Norton. But more than anything else, this is a guilty pleasure because it pushes Matt Damon’s career further along the path of lone-wolf, self-made-man, Horatio Alger type stories. And despite the fact that I fundamentally don’t believe in a world like that, that objectivists make me laugh and shake my head, I can’t help but get swept up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Matt Damon Goodwill Hunting, the Bourne series, Rounders and even his turns in the Oceans’ N films are a big part of his Hollywood success. In each, he plays a man succeeding largely on the parts of his own hard work, wits and charm. It’s much easier to tell a story about a guy like that, to get the film watcher to buy in and see himself on screen than to tell much more complicated stories about social forces, or about doubting yourself even if you have tons of talent. This is not a new argument, but I find it fascinating every time I sit down and watch Good Will Hunting or Rounders - because despite my better self, I can’t help but get caught up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been watching a lot of Robin Williams interviews on YouTube recently, including his famous Inside the Actor’s Studio appearance. His death was brought up in a conversation a few days ago and it started me down this path.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Williams really was a one-of-a-kind actor. But learning about his life, its clear he was a one-of-a-kind man. His background as a runner, his relationships with Christopher Reeves, his children, addiction, his family, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He only got a couple of fleeting moments to dig into his acting reservoir in Mrs. Doubtfire but even just those moments added tremendously to the film. I think he was fully aware of the unique opportunity he had with his film. To explore the depths of his humor, to ad-lib, to let his talents shine, but also to provide children of divorce something to find comfort in. In a decade that saw the highest divorce rates, that amounts to a lot of children who hopefully got something from this film.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rest in peace, Robin.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://letterboxd.com/samarthbhaskar/film/chappie/&quot;&gt;LetterboxD review link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly, I was not expecting that much Die Antwoord. I’m not mad about it, it was just unexpected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But beyond that, Chappie lacked a bigger, driving motivation that was present in District 9. It didn’t have anything new to offer to the genre. It’s final turn, the consciousness babble, wasn’t earned. Chappie’s fumbling and mumbling, and final emotional realization wasn’t properly paced or believable. And even a talented director can only do so much with a 3/4 baked script and actors who don’t seem to believe in the project. Speaking of actors – woof – such flat, uninterested performances turned in by everyone, even seasoned members of the cast like Sigourney Weaver. As someone who writes computer programs everyday, I have never once been as out of breath or exasperated as Dev Patel was every time he was in front of a screen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Part of me fears that after District 9, Blomkamp and Charlto Copley felt some sense of responsibility or pressure to keep coming back to Johannesburg, to keep producing big hits, or message laden commercial films. So far, they haven’t been able to live up to it. In my opinion, the best thing they can do, is to try something completely new. Something that they have strong thoughts on or feelings about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I still think Blomkamp is a unique voice in cinema, his gritty style deserves to be advanced. He just needs to be struck by inspiration in the way he was with District 9.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://letterboxd.com/samarthbhaskar/film/blade-runner/&quot;&gt;LetterboxD review link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blade Runner deserves all the accolades it has received since its release for many reasons. Chief among these is its influence on the sci-fi and noir genre. Many successful films since Blade Runner have employed many of its tools, built worlds that resemble futuristic LA, and lifted character types from this film.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, I don’t think that’s enough to bring Blade Runner up to the status that it deserves. Blade Runner deserves high acclaim because it makes high action comprehensible. It brings complex emotion, intricate world building, challenging photography and cinematography and other artistic successes to a mainstream audience. And more than anything else, it complicates the simple protagonist and villain relationship. By the end of the film, I wasn’t sure I loved Dekker and I certainly didn’t hate Roy. In fact, Dekker spitting in Roy’s face, more or less forcing himself on Rachel, and generally being a shitty guy made it clear that he wasn’t supposed to be a totally lovable protagonist anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I ended up watching a version of this that included the narration from Harrison Ford. I definitely could’ve done without that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A great anthology of short films. Each felt distinct, but had a certain familiar thread throughout. Watching the same director present 6 different ideas back-to-back is a great way to understand just how much directors shape the films they make. This influence is harder to ascertain but also prevalent in a director’s full oeuvre, which of course is the basis of auteur theory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another thread that was flowing throughout this film is the sense of turmoil that contemporary Argentina is going through under Kirchner. Argentina, like many countries in the global financial downturn, have felt a squeeze on the middle class, a distrust in government services and a test of national resolve that is on display in a few of the shorts in this film.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along with 25th Hour and Do The Right Thing, this is one of the tightest scripts Spike Lee has probably worked with. I don’t think he really believed in the movie, though, so there are only sprinklings of his directorial touches and talents on display. For the most part, he just let the script and the actors carry the film, which is ok. Not every project can animate a director equally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is one of those movies that makes it abundantly clear how heavy-handed Hollywood believes it needs to be, in order to convey its point. The same script, same actors, even same director, without the burden of Hollywood’s expectations would probably have produced a much less ham-handed film.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I was a shell of myself when I finished this book. I read the last 1/4 in the gym, on a stationary bike, where I found myself peddling faster to keep myself from exploding with tears. To keep my body from reacting with the visceral force that I was feeling from Mireille’s description of her recovery. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This book started at 10 and only went up from there. Roxane Gay doesn’t give the reader a break. She throws us into the fray and handcuffs us to the protagonist for the length of the novel. Thinking about how much sexual violence women are subject to only deepens how serious this book is. 13 days of captivity, 5 years of recovery and a life changed becomes all the more staggering when you consider that something like 1 in 3 American women is sexually abused at some point in her life. That amounts to so many years living a life that these women never chose to live, could never prepare for and can’t freely leave behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reading books like this, building empathy for victims of violence, understanding what women might feel carrying these heavy weights is difficult work. But I strongly believe it is necessary work. I have many friends, especially in my well-to-do, well-educated, highly busy peer group who would much rather avoid reading something like this. It is difficult to spend time dealing with these strong emotions. I found myself feeling that way a couple of times during this book, but then I thought about this Kafka quote –&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can hold yourself back from the sufferings of the world, that is something you are free to do and it accords with your nature, but perhaps this very holding back is the one suffering you could avoid. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/193451-you-can-hold-yourself-back-from-the-sufferings-of-the)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason this didn’t make it into the echelons of best debut novels is because it lacked certain higher order literary devices. It was hard for me to find literary devices employed throughout the book. The book felt more like a well created hollywood blockbuster rather than an auteur’s attempt at engaging with the genre, or the medium in some serious way. But not everything needs to do that, and what this book attempted to do, to stir up some feelings, it did very well.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>On Kanye West and black ambition</title>
   <link href="/blog/on-kanye-west/"/>

   <id>/blog/on-kanye-west</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;h1 id=&quot;kanyes-evolution&quot;&gt;Kanye’s evolution&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Kanye.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Kanye West&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last week, Slate’s Arthur Chu wrote a piece called &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.salon.com/2015/02/17/kanye_west_vs_white_mediocrity_the_real_story_behind_beck_beyonce_and_snl_40/&quot;&gt;Kanye West Vs. White Mediocrity&lt;/a&gt;. This was on the heels of Kanye’s latest public appearences at the Grammys and SNL’s 40th anniversary. I had an email exchange about the topic that I’ll partially share here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some of this reminded me of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZ0fRBtAB1w&quot;&gt;Chris Rock’s joke&lt;/a&gt; about mediocrity and black people being able to suck. He talks about how Joe Lewis (or someone) was fighting a white boxer and round after round, kicking this guy’s ass. And then in like the 13th round he finally knocks him out and wins the fight. When they went to the judges’ cards, they had Joe Lewis losing the fight.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There’s kind of an interesting argument about resource constraints or opportunity constraints elevating quality. Maybe because there are so few spots for black artists and entertainers, there’s an artificial constraint that’s created. This, in turn, elevates quality. I mean, I’m all for higher quality, but I think there are more humane ways to achieve rather than racism.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I was thinking this during the SNL-40 show: everyone judges Kanye with a lot of baggage. During his performance I was texting with my sister (a huge Kanye fan), watching Twitter (where my networks are largely white, affluent, self-described liberals) - and I &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/samarthbhaskar/status/567168718648909825&quot;&gt;tweeted this&lt;/a&gt;. I think Chu addresses this in his article too, he said something like everyone is judging the thing he did last not what he’s doing right now.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Perfectionism is exhausting/stressful. For Kanye to strive for perfection, for Michael Jackson to have done that, and Nina Simone, and James Baldwin and so many other people - there’s a real cost for this. People are driven into exhaustion, have to leave the country, or worse they pay with their lives. It’s really sad that all these artists want is to express themselves, to pursue their art but once they achieve a certain level of fame, perfection is the only option anymore. And then they end up driving themselves into the ground. And we think we’re rewarding them with our love and adoration, but we’re just feeding their addiction.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I like “whiteness is a roomier identity.” That was a nice way of capturing that sentiment.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, I’ve had a change of heart about Kanye in the last year or so. I used to be the type of guy who’d say “ugh, I loved Kanye when he just stuck to backpack rap. His first few albums were so great. He should’ve just stuck to being a good producer.” I thought I was saying that as a critical consumer of his music, but I was doing exactly what this article is talking about. I was boxing him in, not allowing him to be a full person or a full artist. Now, I’m on board. I’m not uncritical, but I’m along for the ride.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;roxane-gay-on-black-ambition&quot;&gt;Roxane Gay on Black Ambition&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/untamed_state.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;An Untamed State&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to my thoughts on Kanye, I’ve been thinking about a piece my sister shared with me by Roxane Gay. By the way, her debut novel &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1209677063&quot;&gt;An Untamed State&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; knocked me out. In this essay, Gay talks about acheiving success in her career as a writer and educator but never feeling comfortable with it. This is a pretty familiar mental model for me. For all the success I’ve acheived in life, it never feels like I was meant to be successful. I have to constantly remind myself that I earned the things I’ve earned. Certainly not without luck, fortune and support, but also not without hard work and tenacity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of these thoughts are present in Kanye’s maturation. Kanye, more than any artist I know, is fighting to make his success a normal thing. Sometimes that means he’s reaching for bigger, bolder things. Sometimes that means he’s allowing himself the freedom that other successful people might have. If Donald Trump and Mitt Romney feel they can run for president because they were successful in private enterprise, Kanye feels similiary that he should be able to try his hand at fashion because of his success as a music producer. I don’t know if I agree with that basic approach, but I do support Kanye’s ability to do that as much as Trump or Romney are able to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;david-oyelowo-on-obama&quot;&gt;David Oyelowo on Obama&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Oyelowo.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;David Oyelowo&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://the-talks.com/interviews/david-oyelowo/&quot;&gt;David Oyelowo&lt;/a&gt; had a short interview during his post-Selma press rounds where he mentioned that Obama’s presidency has been a boone for Black narratives, actors and projects to get attention. This is not a new idea, but I liked that he got to tell President Obama about it. Despite being a hyper rational guy, I bet it was nice for Obama to hear that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe Kanye, Roxange Gay, David Oyelowo and Barack Obama can be the models that the next generation of artists, authors, politicians can gather inspiration from.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>ISIS follow up - Islamist power in civil war</title>
   <link href="/blog/islamist-power-in-civil-war/"/>
   <updated>2015-02-23T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/islamist-power-in-civil-war</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;As a follow up to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://samarthbhaskar.com/2015/02/19/what-isis-really-wants/&quot;&gt;ISIS response&lt;/a&gt; I posted last week, here’s an &lt;a href=&quot;http://muse.jhu.edu/login?auth=0&amp;amp;type=summary&amp;amp;url=/journals/international_security/v039/39.3.ahmad.html&quot;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; that I came across today. The abstract below states the main conceit, which is that Islamists have a structural advantage in selling security services in the conflict security market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“In civil wars across the world, certain Islamist groups have competed exceptionally well against their rivals. The conventional wisdom points to either religion or ethnic politics to explain Islamist success. These ideological and identity-based explanations, however, tend to overlook the powerful economic influence that the local business class has over civil war outcomes. Civil war can be modeled as a market for security, wherein protection must be purchased from multiple substate rackets. Using this market model, a close investigation of the Somali case reveals why and under what conditions the interests of the profit-driven business class align with those of ideologically motivated Islamist groups. Security costs are of critical importance to businesses in a civil war, and Islamists are uniquely competitive in lowering these costs. The business-Islamist alliance is therefore driven by rational, economic considerations, which can contribute to the rise of Islamist power.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The general point made in this article comes on page 96:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Because Islamists are able to sell security across ethnic and tribal divisions, however, they can offer more competitive prices than groups that primarily sell protection to a narrower pool of prospective buyers. By charging lower margins across the board,Islamists have the ability to capture a larger share of the security market than ethnic or tribal groups. As their market share increases, they can lower their rates further to price out their rivals. Therefore, not only do Islamist groups give businesses the option to leave coercive relationships with ethnic or tribal protection rackets, but they also offer more competitive prices to do so”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This makes sense to me, and the case study of Somalia illustrates the point pretty well. Although there isn’t an official civil war in Syria/Iraq, citizens in the area dealing with ISIS based on rational models makes much more sense than most of the narratives in the media.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>For the Love of Movies The Story of American Film Criticism</title>
   <link href="/movies/for-the-love-of-movies-the-story-of-american-film-criticism/"/>

&lt;p&gt;Good to learn about the history of criticism. I think it’s clear that I could never be successful as a critic because I don’t have the same competitive drive as Ebert, Siskel, Kael or Sarris. I’m totally fine with disagreeing with someone, finding their argument stupid or wrong and then moving on. I have enough anxieties in the world - changing someone’s mind sounds exhausting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can’t remember who said this in the film, but I do hate when I walk out of a movie and someone asks “so what did you think?” I don’t know what I think until hours, days, weeks later when I have had time to write or to gain some emotional distance from what I just watched.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also like Harry Knowles’ (Aint It Cool founder) maxim that went something like, “if all critics have is critical thought, and if we spread criticism to everyone, then we’re essentially spreading critical thought to everyone.” Despite the fact that lower publishing costs, and the democratization of criticism hasn’t proven to be a clear and indisputable panacea, I do like to think that the spread of critical thought is a benevolent outcome.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;After seeing this book recommended across many best-of-2014 lists, I decided to dive in. I find the central question - is it possible to have culture without civilization? - very interesting. Although, if I’m being honest, I don’t think it’s enough interesting enough to rise up in the ranks of some of the best thought experiments to write a book about. However, the author starts with this question and goes to very interesting places. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’m not usually compelled by end-of-world dramas, but this one felt very realistic. I also liked that Toronto played a big role in this book. After reading NYC centric books for the better part of last year, it was nice to mix things up a bit. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ultimately, I think I liked this book because it tried to answer its big main question. I don’t think it ever came up with a clear, precise answer, but it was a good meditation on it.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>3 Women</title>

   <updated>2015-02-19T00:00:00-05:00</updated>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://letterboxd.com/samarthbhaskar/film/3-women/&quot;&gt;LetterboxD review link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My first Robert Altman, and what a one to start with. I find it hard to believe that the same final plot turn would pass in a contemporary film, but that’s perhaps because it has been over used. Maybe in 1977 that idea wasn’t as worn out yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think this is at once a very feminist film and also has a strong male gaze underneath it all. The main characters, Pinky and Millie, were building an independent life for themselves. They talked about men, yes, but I didn’t get the feeling that they couldn’t survive if men weren’t around. However, the odd moments of sexual tension, Millie’s infatuation with men, the strong character archetypes that the 3 women represent in the beginning - all those things seem to me emanating from a man’s mind. I wonder how a woman would try to show the same thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This film is born in water and dies in water. The opening scene brings together birth and death in the same small pool. Water is, again, the catalyst of change when Pinky has her accident. The fluidity of water is present in the fluidity of identities in this film.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Praise and adulation also belong to Duvall and Spacek who are asked to play multiple and entirely different characters in the same film - and are able to pull it off without a hitch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, ultimately, I think responsibility for this film lies with writer and director Robert Altman. He accomplished something very difficult - he made a film that stands on its own as fact and wrapped in logic (ok maybe minus the last 10 minutes) but the whole time is clearly about way more than that.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Response to "What ISIS really wants"</title>
   <link href="/blog/what-isis-really-wants/"/>
   <updated>2015-02-19T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/what-isis-really-wants</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The Atlantic had a cover story last month, which now looks to be deprecated. But here’s a &lt;a href=&quot;http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:http://www.theatlantic.com/features/archive/2015/02/what-isis-really-wants/384980/&quot;&gt;cached version&lt;/a&gt;. The story was about ISIS and its religious underpinnings. My friend Arjun and I discussed it over email last night and I wanted to share some of my thoughts here. I’ve pasted my email to him below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Princeton professor is a cool guy. If I remember correctly, he came to UIUC when I was studying Arabic/Middle Eastern studies and I enjoyed hearing him talk. There was a dude at UIUC who was very similar to him. Secular authority on Islam and Islamic history. The UIUC guy, Khalil, had some interesting things to say - he felt like he had to change the course of his research and scholarship to be more radicalism focused in order to compete for tenure track jobs. I think he was much more interested in other things about the Muslim world, but so it goes, I guess.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I think the author if this Atlantic piece did a pretty good job explaining major tenets of Islam. I was glad to see he differentiated (with some help from Haykel) between Islam and Muslims.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;As he mentioned, the slow and protracted decline of ISIS is most likely what will happen, but what I’m interested in is what a future Islamic state looks like. Saudi has lost favor as the one true Islamic nation. Iran doesn’t get counted because is Shia. But I’m curious if there will be a future state that’ll be the Muslim equivalent of Israel. Israel was founded on very similar grounds. Zionism espouses some of the same tenets as al-Baghdadi’s Salafism. But Zionism, at least in its most severe form, turned out to be untenable (politically, economically, etc) for Israel, so they went down a more moderate road. &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Certainly they had the US’s backing, which helped them survive. I wonder if ISIS will find some sort of moderate version of itself too.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;One thing that I thought was missing from this article was a sense of scale. In fact, that’s something I’ve had a hard time grasping anywhere. I don’t know if we’re talking about 500K citizens, a million, 10M? Talking to some strong advocates can have the unintended effect of making the movement seem a lot bigger in scale than it is. But again, I know they control a huge &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/06/12/world/middleeast/the-iraq-isis-conflict-in-maps-photos-and-video.html?_r=0&amp;amp;pagewanted=all&quot;&gt;swathe&lt;/a&gt; of territory between Syria and Iraq but I don’t know how many people we’re talking about. Part of me thinks that there’s some natural ceiling that they’ll hit, after which they’ll have to start becoming more moderate. Because creating social services, a viable economy, etc for a group of thousands is very different than doing that for hundreds of thousands.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Dave Chappelle had a really funny joke about ISIS/radical Islam on Monday night when I saw him. He was like “ISIS is like the Tupac of religions. It’s like “YO WHAT, I GO SO HARD MOTHERF**. COME AT ME.” It’s hard to convey over email, but he captured the sentiment really well. And like Tupac, at least younger Tupac, that level of bravado is something that goes away with age. Maybe ISIS will mature out of this stage. Unfortunately their “immaturity” manifests in severed heads, slaves, beaten women, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The author’s description of his conversations with the English and Australian extremists was really interesting. When people betray a strong confidence, have an answer to everything and can convince you, I find that really fascinating. I’m not that confident about anything in my life. I almost envy it. They’ve bought into it wholesale. Muslim communities in the US and elsewhere are having a hard time counteracting online recruitment of young men and women. It’s hard to come back to “we have a strong and principled view about everything” with “well, things are complicated.” It’s not as convincing an argument.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:1&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;that’s probably one of the only times you’ll hear me describe Israel as moderate. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:1&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had never seen this documentary before. Watching it this week, after starting a new job in the newsroom at the Times and after David Carr’s passing was pretty potent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Carr takes this from what would’ve otherwise been a tick-tock of the inside of a massive machine, producing the daily miracle, and injects a deep, pulsing humanity into it. His relationship with younger reporters, the way he interacts with his editors, and how in turn his editors promote him to the masthead or defend him from outside pressure - that’s what this documentary is about. I’m afraid that message gets lost at times in all the talk about the death of the newspaper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of things have changed in the last 5 years of course, the biggest being that the Times is not nearly as close to bankruptcy as it once was, but a lot still stays the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the short 3 weeks that I’ve been at the Times, I’ve come to know one thing very clearly - the newsroom is as much about the relationships this documentary features as it is about the news produced every day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main conceit of this film required a lot of exposition. However, any more exposition in this film and it would’ve been too much. At the same time, I still felt lost even in the middle of the 3rd act. That’s a tough place to corner yourself into as a writer and film-maker. I’m not one to argue that some things are too complicated to convey in a 2-hour film, but I think the task went past what this film could do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also don’t think the film needed to turn Tom Cruise’s character into a saved, loving person. Or that he and Emily Blunt needed to develop a romantic relationship. Sometimes, its just okay for a guy and a girl to be friends.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://letterboxd.com/samarthbhaskar/film/still-alice/&quot;&gt;LetterboxD review link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll be honest, I wasn’t expecting much from this film. The trailer was pretty flat, I didn’t think the story arc would do much more than just explore the sadness a family experiences when dealing with illness. But Julianne Moore, almost single-handedly, lifted this film up into a much higher category.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m very glad Julianne Moore is a part of contemporary cinema as I’ve come of age. She’s shown up in so many of my favorite films, commercial, cult, independent, and in so many genres. Her turns in films as diverse as Boogie Nights, The Big Lebowski, The Lost World, The Kids are Alright and now Still Alice are a testament to her commitment to acting. She takes her work very seriously, but has never betrayed a cold, professional distance from her characters. I think someone like Daniel Day Lewis also takes his work as seriously, but the warmth that Moore provides again and again is lacking from Lewis’ oeuvre. It would make me very happy to see her received the awards and accolades she’s earned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although my taste usually bend toward the cerebral, and Still Alice never really challenged me in that way, I found myself getting teary eyed more than once. I connected strongly with Alice and John, their lives and careers. They are both academics, although more the white collar kind, not exactly intellectuals. I’m not an academic, but I do aspire to a learned life like theirs. In one scene, when Alice’s doctor claims that highly educated patients of Alzheimer’s often experience worse symptoms, I found myself thinking about my choices now. I spend so much time reading, learning, expanding my knowledge about the world. What if I pay that cost later in my life? What if there are consequences I’m not even considering. I’m sure I was just getting caught up in the emotions of the film, but it is something I’ve considered once or twice before - because I can see how flooding my brain with information constantly can lead to a lasting confused state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wouldn’t say this was the best written or directed film of the year. But I think it very much deserves the praise it’s receiving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is so much going on in this film, but it still keeps its center and forward motion. Of all the allusions and themes, my favorite is Polanski’s take on femininity. Polanski digs into some the frustrations of pre-modern and modern femininity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tension built by the single-location shoot, the details in each apartment, the aesthetic impact of clothing, furniture and other details really puts this film in a category of its own. Although most of the actors carry the movie very well, I was most impressed with John Cassavettes. He brought, at once, a gravity and buoyancy to his role that elevated the film.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Admittedly, I haven’t seen many films from this era, but starting in on Polanski’s oeuvre has made me excited about seeing more great works from the 50s, 60s and 70s. I’ve spoken on here before about my discomfort with watching works by people who have pretty clearly been awful people in their lives, but for now I’m casting that aside and basking in his genius.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the few critically-acclaimed films that I missed last year. All the praise for its cinematography was spot on. The landscapes, portraits of characters faces, spacing between character who were interacting and framing of buildings and rooms was impeccable. The film could’ve gotten away with just studying all the grays in our world, alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, unfortunately, in terms of substance, it doesn’t go far beyond there. The 2nd and 3rd act don’t build up enough substance to really carry this film from beautiful to meaningful. But as others have said, maybe that’s just because this film is about Ida’s first act. And although we see her aunt’s final act, the film is much less interested in that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some interesting actor-director pairings in recent years that I’ve enjoyed. Fassbender+McQueen, Goslin+Winding Refn, DiCaprio+Scorcese, among many others. This pairing between Gyllenhaal and Villeneuve seems like a junior varsity version of that. So far at least. Both Enemy and Prisoners seemed like they were a draft of edits away from a tighter, more capturing film. Maybe they’ll both stick at it and come out with better stuff in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could’ve also done with some cinematographic and color diversity in this film. Maybe the whole thing was supposed to feel like one nightmare in one person’s head, but it was too monotonic after a while.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gyllenhaal put in a strong performance though. A character very dissimilar from his Nightcrawler character, but played with a similar level of depth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First Polanski I’ve seen in a long long time. And it totally blew me away. What a fantastic film, every detail was impressive. Nicholson, Dunaway and even the supporting cast all did some great work here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This film felt ultra-modern even though it was made in 1974. In some ways it felt as fresh as Kubrick’s 2001 even though films in these genres have been made for decades after their release.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was hard not to think about Polanski the man while appreciating Polanski the director. Especially near the end of the film when the final huge plot detail is revealed, I couldn’t help but wonder if those are thoughts Polanski has had himself about young women. I’m still torn about supporting artists like Polanski, Woody Allen and Bill Cosby. It makes it all the more difficult when they make incredible work like this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I missed this 2013 hit in the year it came out. 2013 was quiet a year, with the likes of Zero Dark Thirty, Lincoln, Django, Beasts of the Southern Wild and Amour all competing for top honors. I don’t think Nebraska belonged up there next to some of those films, but it certainly deserved more praise than Argo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bruce Dern was very impressive in this role. It didn’t ask much of him in the way of physical feats or dialog delivery, but it seemed his internal ticking was right in line with what the character called for. Some of the looks on his face, and his reactions to the cast showed a real understanding of this character.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This film also captured midwestern/fly-over-state sadness really well. Central IL isn’t as desolate as Montana, Wyoming and Nebraska, but I still feel very blue there when I return. Nebraska captured those blues perfectly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;woops, just realized it competed in 2014. Well, most of my points still stand.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I liked this film, but not as much as a lot of people liked it last year. The film was very well cast, including Maggie Gyllenhaal (about whom I cannot stop thinking after Honorable Woman binges). But the out and out winner in the cast is Fassbender. Even including his turns in the recent X-Men films, he has yet to really disappoint. Although seeing him play a lovable, although broken, character - I just wanted more of him as the despicable, scary types he plays in Steve McQueen films.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Some thoughts on newsroom analytics</title>

   <updated>2015-01-27T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/some-thoughts-on-newsroom-analytics</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I recently left my job at &lt;a href=&quot;www.etsy.com&quot;&gt;Etsy&lt;/a&gt; as a data analyst to join the newsroom at the &lt;a href=&quot;www.nytimes.com&quot;&gt;New York Times&lt;/a&gt;. In addition to being sad to leave Etsy, and learning &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt; in my 2 years there, I’m very excited to work with talented journalists and technologists at the Times to help usher the organization into a new era.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve only made it to day-2 but I thought I’d take a moment to write down some thoughts about starting on this new endeavor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;innovation-report-and-audience-development&quot;&gt;Innovation Report and audience development&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The team I am joining, Audience Development, was born out of the leaked, and much discussed, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scribd.com/doc/224608514/The-Full-New-York-Times-Innovation-Report&quot;&gt;innovation report&lt;/a&gt;. Taking a hard look at the competitive news industry, the NYT decided to set some difficult goals and make some changes. The business side (subscription, ads, finance) of the organization has long used experiments, data analysis and similar empirical tools to make decisions. The newsroom is working on building up the same competencies for news decisions. Analytics, as it happens, is one of these competencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;among-the-many-things-i-have-to-learn&quot;&gt;Among the many things I have to learn&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What the NYTimes is about and how to think critically about the news consumer. I was able to advocate for the Etsy user pretty well after my 2 years there; thanks in large part to many experiments, user research and tons of data analysis. I would like to learn about and advocate for the NYT news reader in the same way.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How does the NYTimes plan on carrying its success in high quality journalism over to the digital age.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Because I joined the analyst team at Etsy near its beginning, I was helped with a wide variety of projects and products. I think I have a similar opportunity in joining the newsroom analytics team at its beginning at the Times. I’m eager to see what parts of the newsroom could benefit from studying user behavior in making their work better.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Web experiments have had a &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.okcupid.com/index.php/we-experiment-on-human-beings/&quot;&gt;controversial&lt;/a&gt; year, but I still believe they’re the best way to assess causality. Finding a smart and appropriate way to bring experiments into the newsroom will be a challenge. At the onset, though, I believe there’s a place for it in the newsroom and it can be done successfully.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At Etsy, we were pretty lucky to have clear metrics of success. The more sales we could generate for our sellers, the better. A similar “north star” metric is harder to point out in news consumption. I’m sure many at the Times and in the industry have thought critically about this, but it doesn’t seem obvious to me yet. In fact, I think the lack of a clear metric of success is often what derails analytics projects. I’d like to avoid getting derailed by the wrong metrics.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;onward&quot;&gt;Onward!&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m excited to take on this challenge. I’m passionate about seeing the NYTimes survive into the digital age. I’m convinced that the type of journalistic expertise the Times has developed over its 150 year history deserves an audience in our new media landscape. And I’m thankful to have learned what I learned in the last 2 years to help me get started.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Selma is one of the best films of the year. And much like The Kings Speech it snuck in near the end of the year to, likely, sweep a lot of Oscars. However, unlike The Kings Speech, I think this film will stand the test of time much better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DuVernay stepped up to the challenge of directing this film and knocked it out of the park. She paid homage to Attenborough’s Gandhi, and Gandhi himself, in choices like having a news reporter narrate and emotionally carry the audience through a major scene (Bloody Sunday). She also never lost a site of history in the story, bringing Washington, Gandhi, Jackson and many other figures into the film.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No performance (save maybe Oprah’s) was off point. All the actor’s in the film, it seemed, knew the weight of what they were doing and they, like their director, rose to the challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally caught up with this film from earlier this year. A lot of my favorite critics had this in their top-films-of-2014 lists, but I don’t think it quite cracked it for me. I thought it was a well-made, atmospheric film. It elevated the otherwise pedestrian stuff that we’ve seen featuring vampires in the last 5-7 years. A depressed vampire is a pretty funny premise. And I liked that it featured Detroit as a character. I’m pretty fascinated by that city, and its slow death.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it never crossed into another level for me. It’s answer for “why is life worth living,” wasn’t 100% believable or compelling. Maybe I expect too much when someone tries to answer that question, but if you’re gonna try to answer a big question like that, you better come up with some big answers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This film meant a lot to me, because Roger Ebert meant a lot to me. Ebert played a big role in getting me into cinema, into making films more than just entertainment or cultural currency. We also have some biographical similarities. I grew up in Central Illinois, attended the University of Illinois, went to University of Chicago for grad school and called Chicago home for a while. I’ve since departed, but still Chicago a big part of my identity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I saw Steve James, someone I admire a lot for both The Interrupters and Hoop Dreams, was tapped to make this film, I couldn’t find my wallet fast enough to donate to the effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To Ebert, movies were empathy generating machines. To me, Ebert’s writing and his contribution to bringing movies to the masses amplified that empathy far beyond its original reach.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It’s too bad this book is so easy to read, because you might end up reading all of it and then realize it wasn’t really that impressive at all. It’s about white men, engaging in self-congratulatory work, dealing with self-involved problems and never looking outside their own world. I love New York, I love reading books about New York, however this book is about a New York I don’t know (Park Ave, Upper East/West, Exeter, literary galas, reclusive authors) and I don’t really care to know. I’d much rather read about the New York Zadie Smith, James Baldwin, Teju Cole or even Woody Allen talk about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Top Five ended up being way funnier than I expected, and also way more real. I don’t think this movie would’ve been possible without Louis CK and “Louie” in particular. I’m really glad Chris Rock took his encouraging words and wrote a really meaningful movie. This is definitely the first “great Chris Rock movie” as others have said. The cameo, in itself, was a character in the film. And all the cameos were hilarious, some even more than others. Some of the stories this film tells had to have happened in real life to Chris Rock, there’s no way he just made that up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m glad he didn’t try to say anything huge or expansive about fame or creativity, he just shared his thoughts based on experiences he has had as a long time artist, and I bought it. Rock has always reminded me of those awkward, lanky, sinewy men I know in my life, who rarely jump out of their shell. But somehow Rock eschewed that character type, became a hugely successful entertainer and this movie is proof that it wasn’t an accident. All of this happened to Chris Rock because he has a big heart and a big brain in that otherwise lanky, awkward, sinewy body of his.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among the better foreign films I’ve seen this year. I liked the questions and provocations it offered about nature, human nature, gender, marriage and modernity. I think the actors did a good job keeping the writing front and center, creating a dark atmosphere and making me feel just weird enough that my attention was captured the whole time. The director, also, did his part in making me uncomfortable from beginning to end, which helped carry the message for this film.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m glad Tomas, the father, came to a place by the end of the film where he was comfortable being himself. It’s unfortunate that who he ended up being was not really too impressive a man.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The breakdown Tomas has about 2/3 of the way through the movie, is something I’ve wondered about myself. Will I be proud of the man I grow up to be? I’m sure there will be regrets and habits that I’m not proud of, but hopefully, in the large sense, I can be proud of the man, father, husband I end up being. I think I knew a few fathers, husbands, older men in my life who don’t feel very proud of who they ended up being. And institutions like marriage, parenthood, work, masculinity don’t make it easy to confront that and change it.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;One of the best books I’ve read this year. The characters were well developed, I cared and worried about each of them. The world was at once intimate and grand. All of the troubles the protagonist went through are the troubles that plague America. And much like the auther, Henderson, I’m optimistic that America will be ok, no matter how messed up it is. I never once felt bored in this book, which is an accomplishment for a book of more than 450 pages. Even when it wasn’t action packed, it never felt navel-gazey. And although the book never prominently featured a person of color, I never felt like it lacked empathy for humanity. Maybe because it beat up all of its characters equally. Henderson has done a marvelous job with his first novel, I hope this only means more stellar work in his future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My biggest problem: overwrought exposition. Ham-handed writing. A character named Mann to tell us about the folly of man. C’mon, Nolan, give me more credit as a audience member.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The film is beautiful. The score is fantastic. The actors do a bang-up job. But ultimately it falls apart because of Chris and Jonathan Nolan’s directing and writing. The film made me wish for Gravity’s simplicity, for 2001’s focus and for Inception’s execution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bummer this didn’t end up being one of my favorites of the year. I was looking forward to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had a lot of fun watching Nightcrawler. Gyllenhaal is definitely at the top of his game here. Even his face is more gaunt, which adds to the overall creepiness of this character. His assistant, played by Riz Ahmed (who was great in Four Lions), was one of my favorite characters as well. Although I could do without Hollywood’s repeated use of Latino/South Asian actors to play the mismatched Latino/South Asian parts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I sometimes get a little tired of LA as a character in films, because it seems so navel-gazy, but this film used LA properly. Night-time LA has a Michael Mann sort of feel to it and it came out beautifully in this film. And watching Los Angeles Plays Itself last year gave me a new appreciation for why LA has been so important to Hollywood films.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides all the juicy character and plot stuff, this movie was a pretty sardonic take on modern ambition and achievement. The things Gyllenhaal and Russo’s characters do, and how little/flimsy push back they get are pretty scathing critiques of success in the modern economy. The film has a lot to say about media consumption, production and I liked that it balanced all that well with a great story and fascinating characters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not sure this film will stand up to some of the other great 2014 releases, but it’s definitely a strong addition to my growing list of 2014 favorites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is bound to be a polarizing film. It seems to me the best way to observe this film is to be keenly aware that you’re sitting in a theater, watching artists talk about art. If you don’t keep that frame of focus in mind, its easy to miss (what I think is the point) of the film.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One clear success was bringing Ed Norton back up in my list of favorite all time actors. Embarrassing to admit now but American History X was one of my first loves in film in high school. For a long time I considered Ed Norton to be my favorite actor. 25th Hour helped keep him there. But for a long time he has made safe choices and hasn’t seemed to grow. This movie threw that pattern out of the window. He did a fantastic job in a challenging role.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keaton, too, was a strong point in this movie. He carried a disjointed, maniacal, schizophrenic film by being just as maniacal and schizo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I liked the things it had to say about criticism. For what its worth, my favorite commentary on criticism is Pixar’s Ratatouille.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, though, this might just get thrown in the closet with the many attempts artists have made at commenting on art itself. After a while, all that commentary just seems self-congratulatory and like they want is to bloviate at length about a tired topic. The majority of people in the world are not artists, take a risk, learn something about them, say something new about them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I need to see this film about 3 more times before I figure out how to feel about it. But then again, I felt that way about There Will Be Blood and The Master, both of which are squarely near the top of my all-time favorites. However, it is very possible that this movie isn’t meant for the same kind of understanding. I don’t think it has the same meaningful ideas to deliver about its topic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First impressions: so many details, so many plot points to follow. At times it felt like reading Heidegger while tripping. Which made me realize, maybe this is PTA’s attempt at portraying what the world feels like when your relationship to it (like the protagonist’s) is heavily doped up. Was Joaquin Phoenix on screen literally the whole time? Because his performance was light and silly, does it make it any less of an achievement than Daniel Day Lewis being on screen the whole time in There Will Be Blood?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the PTA filmography, this felt a lot more like Boogie Nights (not least because it’s around the same era) than The Master or There Will Be Blood. Although Boogie Nights was way more ambitious in trying to capture big ideas about porn/money/industry while Inherent Vice just asks questions (like The Master).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe PTA is moving in a post-modern or historicist direction as he moves forward as a film maker. Inherent Vice felt like a real product of the era is it was set in. Cultural references, lighting choices, the gritty details on each character’s face and body were all spot on. But situating a question in its historical context is not the same as answering that question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The real failure of post-modernism was that it got really good at asking questions, but never at answering them in any satisfactory way. I hope PTA doesn’t fall prey to that same failure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe Reitman will never make anything like Juno or Up In The Air, ever again. That’s a sad thought.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In physics, related to the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, there is an idea that we cannot study something without it changing. I think Reitman tried too early to study the effects of electronic communication on people’s lives. I think these effects are still in flux and we don’t quite have a grasp on what’s happening just yet. Or if we do, Reitman didn’t really present it in a convincing way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His directorial fingerprints, though, were all over the film and made it enjoyable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For some reason, I can never take Jennifer Garner seriously. She is not a good actress, in this humble viewer’s opinion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But still, a fine entry in this year’s increasingly awesome set of films.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I enjoyed watching this film, but I don’t think it will be memorable. In the pantheon of Fincher films, I don’t see this standing the test of time like Seven, Social Network, Zodiac and others. But it was a damn fun movie-going experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A great duo performance, made me think of Phoenix + Hoffman from The Master (certainly less virtuosic though). Teller is very talented and so is JK Simmons’ face and voice. I’m usually not a big band jazz lover but I loved every piece of music in this film. I’ve been watching youtube compilations of drummers since I saw it. A great film!&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;All the praise this book upon release and since is totally worth it. I can’t think of another debut novel that had an author so sure of herself and so clear in her own voice. I’ve always loved reading Zadie Smith’s NY Review of Books pieces, thought I’d jump in to her novels, glad I started with this one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seeing this after seeing PTA’s later work (There Will Be Blood and The Master) took away some of the magic that I might have felt if I saw this when it first arrived. It is nothing short of amazing. PTA made nothing short of a masterpiece, but he has matured so much since this film that I can’t quite put this at #1 on my PTA list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;None the less, its a magnificent story, structured well, cast perfectly, directed with patience and executed flawlessly. Even Mark Wahlberg has enough support around him to pull of the job of a lead actor without having the chops to really do it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Marin Ireland is a much better actress than Chris Messina, turns out. But both of them together are not good enough to carry a film like this. The “improvised” scenes were awkward, overbearing and clumsy. They probably could’ve been tightened up with a better script or maybe a better director. I think one or two more re-writes and this would’ve been a much better film.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s like writing an article or a book. Films are never finished either. You can always edit a little more. This one came out of the even just a little too early.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I fear Fassbender + McQueen handled this topic better in Shame. I was impressed with what Von Trier had to say about depression in Melancholia but I’m not as taken with what he has to say about sex and guilt in this film. I suppose to should watch Vol. II to complete the story, but there’s hardly anything bringing me back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, it was beautiful. And despite being heavy handed I liked the conversations between the protagonists telling the story through conversation.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Probably one of the best pop-philosophy books I’ve ever read. Nussbaum is incredibly smart, about so many topics. Feminism, sexual ethics, manliness, Indian political history, sartorial philosophy are all discussed in interesting, contextualized, deep ways. Her ability to bring in writers from Aristotle, Plato to Charles Taylor into the conversation is also remarkable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only thing keeping it from a 5-star review is that Nussbaum sometimes ends up making ad-hominem attacks, especially at other philosophers like Judith Butler, which I think she could do without.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The writing, direction and acting was really great - especially the first 3 acts. I fear the movie sets up a question it just can’t answer by the final act.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Duplass deserves all the praise he’s receiving for his work in this film, he quickly won me over on screen and kept my respect throughout. I don’t know if the fact that he helped produce this movie is completely unrelated. I think he took this role more seriously than past work. Moss, on the other hand, was effective at best.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I’ve said so far makes it sound like I didn’t enjoy the movie. But don’t let me fool you - I enjoyed this movie a lot. The two protagonists carried the film throughout, the dialog was crisp and poignant, the themes evergreen and what the writer had to say about those themes original and worthwhile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I expected at first to be wow-ed, then depressed, then shocked, then affected, but pretty much none of those things happened. This film made me think about character, and who we present to the word, the mask we wear (not unlike the Kabuki-esque white mask Lila has on at the beginning of this film). The energy this movie emits, rather seeps out, about teenage need for acceptance is probably more in line with how sad that need for acceptance is than most other movies on that topic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Saw this over brunch at Nighthawk in Williamsburg. This movie is too strange to work, I thought at the beginning, but by the end I didn’t want it to stop. Both characters were perfect, their harmony was perfect. A real treasure of a film.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think Maude could have been treated as a little more of an independent person, outside the definition of taking care of Harold or being his guide to a fuller life. This is mostly a half-baked thought though, not a real complaint.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And of course the opposite (old man, young woman) would’ve been super controversial. Gender is exhausting sometimes.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>A few words about my experience at MAPSS, UChicago</title>
   <link href="/blog/grad%20school/a-few-words-about-my-experience-at-mapss-uchicago/"/>
   <updated>2014-07-29T08:24:48-04:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/grad%20school/a-few-words-about-my-experience-at-mapss-uchicago</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Someone approached me &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Talmudist/status/492464737351790592&quot;&gt;on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; a few days ago with some questions about &lt;a href=&quot;http://mapss.uchicago.edu/&quot;&gt;MAPSS&lt;/a&gt;. We had a short email exchange recently that I thought I&#39;d share on here in case other incoming MAPSS students are interested in learning about my experience there. This is, obviously, just one anecdote about what MAPSS is like, but hopefully readers can gather some insights to inform their decisions or expectations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hi [redacted], &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Happy to help answer questions. I&#39;ll take them in turn, below.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Firstly, regarding cost: I totally agree with you. It&#39;s an, almost prohibitively, expensive program. I was very naive at the time of application and didn&#39;t really consider that too much. Now I&#39;m glad I went forward with it because my life wouldn&#39;t be the same without the training I received at MAPSS. But if I were faced with the same decision again, and I soberly assessed my probabilities of success, I don&#39;t know if I could make the same call as a rational man. I&#39;m glad I got lucky and fell at the tail end of that probability of success and can now afford to pay my student loans :-).&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gmail_extra&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gmail_quote&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;im&quot;&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;gmail_quote&quot;&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;1. If you don&#39;t mind being frank, when and why did you decide not to pursue a PhD? &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; I took a couple of the first year PhD courses along with the first year PhD students who were starting in poli sci. It was clear to me right away that these students were better theorists, writers, thinkers than me. They came to MAPSS with better training, had written better undergraduate theses and were way better read than me. I knew I would have to play a lot of catch-up to get to their level, all the while they would be getting even sharper with access to tenured advisors, reading and writing just like I was.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;One of the first year requirements for poli sci PhDs was a course called &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://political-science.uchicago.edu/academics/courses.shtml&quot;&gt;Data Analysis&lt;/a&gt;,&quot; which was basically an intro into empirical reasoning. I found myself really enjoying discussions in that class, and we got a quick taste for statistical data analysis. I also talked a lot with my preceptor at that time about taking methods courses. My preceptor was honest about the positive experiences she had in methods courses and about how she was seeing her colleagues who were methodologists really succeed in the field. Combined with seeing what kinds of papers were making it into top journals, being a middle east studies student and not really finding [redacted] or [redacted] that impressive (&lt;a href=&quot;http://political-science.uchicago.edu/people/faculty/wedeen.shtml&quot;&gt;Lisa Wedeen&lt;/a&gt;, unfortunately, was away that semester) and not really being super enthusiastic about writing about civil war and terrorism (that&#39;s what other ME poli sci people were writing about) - I pivoted to methods work.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;I still ended up writing my thesis about middle east topics, but with more emphasis on statistical methods I used to push forward my argument.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;im&quot;&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;gmail_quote&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;2. Did you have a significant quant background before attending MAPSS? I also come from a Poli Sci/Poli Theory background...I was wondering how abrupt and difficult the transition was to more quant-oriented courses. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;I had no quantitative background before coming in to MAPSS. I, like a lot of people in the social sciences, never considered myself a &quot;math person.&quot; I attended math camp before classes started and realized that I actually was better at remembering and applying concepts from high school than most of my peers. That was a heartening step, and boosted my confidence to take methods courses. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;While taking methods courses I frequented office hours (TA&#39;s and professor&#39;s) often. I also, almost always, completed problem sets as part of a group. I found it really frustrating to run into walls by myself and not know how to move on. But in groups, running into walls seemed less daunting. I&#39;m certain I wouldn&#39;t have been as successful at those problem sets or methods work in general if it wasn&#39;t for classmate, TA and professor support.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;I also found programing in R and Latex to be a fun exercise. It was my first time working with a low level programming language like R and the syntactical sugar of Latex was a fun challenge to work at. A few of my classmates hated coding, so they had a much harder time finishing problem sets and getting the most out of the course.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;im&quot;&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;gmail_quote&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;3. What is your experience of U Chicago&#39;s career services and alumni network? Did you avail yourself of those connections? &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;I tried to use career services often, especially at the beginning of my time at MAPSS. The designated MAPSS career counselor, [redacted], was helpful but quickly directed me toward the larger career center. They basically sent me off to job fairs, and directed me to job sites like Idealist. Partially my own fault for not being more clear, but I never found career services (at UChicago or my undergraduate institution) to be very helpful. I think if you have a clear idea of what you want (&quot;I want to go to law school&quot; or &quot;I want to be a management consultant&quot;), these types of services can be more useful. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Since I graduated, it seems to me that MAPSS has really gone much further in this area. [Redacted] (current MAPSS career counselor) has organized a lot successful programs (including the one where you caught &lt;a href=&quot;http://samarthbhaskar.wordpress.com/2013/05/31/uchicago-mapss-alumni-talk/&quot;&gt;my talk&lt;/a&gt;) and seems to have a much better approach to answering these questions, from what I can gather. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;im&quot;&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;gmail_quote&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;4. What was your time at MAPSS like? Did you involve yourself in extracurriculars at all? Did you socialize a great deal with your MAPSS Cohort?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;My time at MAPSS was very stressful, but overall the best intellectual growth opportunity I could&#39;ve asked for. I lived in Wicker Park, away from campus, which was hugely helpful. An hour commute separating me from the stress and tension of coursework, writing a thesis, intense classroom debate, etc was very necessary. It allowed me to carve a life outside of MAPSS, spend time with people who knew nothing about my graduate work and didn&#39;t care about it and give my brain a break every night for a couple of hours. My peers at MAPSS, who lived in Hyde Park, all hung out with each other, all complained and gossiped about the same coursework, long hours, professors, etc. I think this had deleterious effects on their ability to perform at a high level and keep a clear mind about their goals.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;I sang with the University choir a few nights a week, which was a nice break from course/thesis work as well. I spent many hours in the libraries, like others, but I tried to treat it like a job. I would arrive early in the morning and work as much as possible before, between and after courses, but I would wrap up and go home for dinner. I have some close friends from my MAPSS cohort, although they represent many disciplines beyond poli sci. I mostly spent time with them grabbing a drink after an evening class, or attending workshops together, or seeing a talk on campus. Oddly enough, most of the people I spent many hours in the library with, working on problem sets, I&#39;m not close with anymore. Take that however you will, ha.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;im&quot;&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;gmail_quote&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;5. Do you have any tips or recommendations regarding the MAPSS experience that you would impart to someone beginning the program?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;I think it&#39;s really important to set goals for yourself and keep yourself oriented toward those goals. That&#39;s not to say goals can&#39;t change, or that you need to know what you&#39;re doing on day 1, but 9-12 months is a very short time and UChicago is an immense place. Your intellectual curiosity can last you forever, but that won&#39;t help you figure out what you want to do once the program ends. I was lucky to figure out that I didn&#39;t want to apply to PhD programs after, so I focused on finding employment. I decided that I didn&#39;t want to let my thesis bleed over into the summer, that I wanted to take that time to find a job, so I worked to finish my thesis by March. I wouldn&#39;t have been able to do that if I didn&#39;t know way back in September that that was a goal for me. My preceptor, advisors and peers were able to help keep me on track because I made it clear from the onset that I wanted to meet every deadline and stay on track to finish my thesis by March. I also picked courses accordingly so the work I was doing for those courses could help me advance my thesis. Almost every chapter of my thesis came from papers I wrote for other classes. This was crucial in helping me workshop each part with a different scholar, and not double my work at the end. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Although it&#39;s very important to stay focused on your ultimate goal, you&#39;d be remiss to miss opportunities that UChicago has to offer that are basically only available at UChicago. I saw many amazing speakers, attended lots of great workshops, spent time in office hours with great scholars and got to know a lot of peers. These are things, I believe, you can do without straying from your own goals. They enhance the experience so much more than a 80 or 90 page thesis that shows the sum total of your knowledge about one topic.  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Sorry if I rambled on a bit here, I mostly meant to say everything that was on my mind without filtering too much. I imagine you have lots of ideas about these things yourself, so you can take or leave as much or as little as you&#39;d like from this.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;All the best as you prepare for the busy year ahead! I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll have a great experience!&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I remember seeing &lt;em&gt;Garden State&lt;/em&gt; in high school and really loving it. I re-watched it after I learned how to watch film, and it completely fell flat on its face. This movie won’t take 2 viewings to confirm that. Braff is a college freshman, stuck in some Philosophy 101 repetitive loop about happiness, confidence, family and whatever other amorphous topic you can throw at it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mandy Patinkin spent the first half of his career as Inigo Montoya, and now will spend the second half as Saul Berenson. It’s too bad because he’s actually got a lot to offer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A fine performance by Tim Heidecker, but I fear this film about irony never really says anything meaningful about the topic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was reminded of the David Foster Wallace quote about irony [1] and how it is a dangerous thing. Once you use irony or sarcasm to debunk something, or point out a flaw, then what? It should be incumbent upon you to at least try an offer an alternative.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>An unsolicited thought about Soylent</title>
   <link href="/blog/culture%20and%20society/technology/an-unsolicited-thought-about-soylent/"/>
   <updated>2014-07-22T20:47:19-04:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/culture%20and%20society/technology/an-unsolicited-thought-about-soylent</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://samarthbhaskar.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/soylent.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-1056 aligncenter&quot; src=&quot;assets/soylent.jpg?w=226&quot; alt=&quot;soylent&quot; width=&quot;226&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ran across a lot of chatter about &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.portraitsincreativity.com/maira-kalman&quot;&gt;Soylent&lt;/a&gt; today, around the internet and with my friends. I&#39;m curious about the stuff, but I think there is something sort of troubling about the very idea too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firstly, I &lt;a href=&quot;http://samarthbhaskar.com/post/my-love-for-culinary-tourism&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;love&lt;/em&gt; food&lt;/a&gt; a lot. So I mostly consider Soylent an affront to my personal and emotional attachment to experiencing food. I mean, I&#39;m mostly joking, but I&#39;m also sort of serious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also understand that Soylent is meant to serve as a supplement for people who find taking time out of their day to prepare, obtain and consume food annoying. The fact that Soylent was created by, is being championed by, and largely funded by the tech community is not coincidence. Tech, in my ways, infantilizes its members. There are many fantasies in tech that culminate with an engineer or coder being some sort of hyper-efficient programmer, only capable of one thing. The fact that major tech companies offer to do your laundry, feed you on site and give you a ride from home to work is not unrelated. There is some ideal at work underneath all of this that when you were young your parents took care of all these needs and now your company (your new parent) can take care of it. It might be a stretch, but a beige, tasteless substance that meets your every nutritional need is not too far from what your mother provides for you after birth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But even all of that isn&#39;t what bothers me about Soylent. What worries me is that Soylent was able to raise nearly &lt;a href=&quot;http://venturebeat.com/2013/06/21/soylent-crowdfunding-campaign-attracts-755k-so-people-can-survive-without-food/&quot;&gt;$1 million on Kickstarter&lt;/a&gt;. What worries me is that the likes of Andreesen Horowitz are &lt;a href=&quot;http://techcrunch.com/2013/10/21/soylent/&quot;&gt;investing money&lt;/a&gt; in it. I think this is what takes Soylent from some project to work around a human&#39;s need for food or aesthetic pleasure in experiencing food, to something that becomes a commodity for investment. I don&#39;t think Andreesen Horowitz look at a product like this and glance over its potential application as a complete replacement for food not just for engineers but everyone. I can see a future when governments&#39; with food aid programs look to Soylent as some sort of solution to hunger and malnutrition crises. It&#39;s not hard to imagine a rationale that flows something like -- &quot;well people are dying of hunger around the world, give them Soylent, *claps dusty hands*, my job here is done.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that&#39;s not what solving the problem of malnutrition is about. It&#39;s not that &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malthusian_catastrophe#Criticism&quot;&gt;we don&#39;t have enough food&lt;/a&gt; to feed the world&#39;s hungry, it&#39;s that we&#39;re really bad at distributing food equitably. Even if we see a problem like malnutrition or starvation being solved by something like Soylent - then what? What will these people, who have been saved from the edge of starvation do? Will they have access to education? Will they be given a chance to find a job that pays enough of a salary to survive? Will they have the opportunity to find housing in a place of their choosing? What favor have we done them by keeping them alive with Soylent? More likely, will we walk away feeling like we&#39;ve done our job by giving them Soylent so their basal nutritional needs are met while we could care less about needs that come after that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have no intention of painting this picture as the actual or even presumed intentions of the inventors of Soylent. I don&#39;t think they or their investors see this as the problem they&#39;re solving. I don&#39;t have a hard time believing that the inventors of Soylent, their investors and all who are enthusiastic about the product genuinely believe it will be something office workers use as a substitute to walking out and getting an fat laden sandwich for lunch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I do believe, as &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/The-Technological-Society-Jacques-Ellul/dp/0394703901/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1406082811&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;keywords=jacques+ellul&quot;&gt;Jacques Ellul&lt;/a&gt; believed, that technological progress is irreversible. With the exception of the nuclear weapon, society has never reversed the forward movement of technology. So to go blindly on the path of innovation, to try and disrupt everything, to invent for the sake of invention carries with it another responsibility. I think it is the responsibility of the inventor, of the investor, of the problem solver to consider his/her innovation in a broader social context. And I think this is what ultimately bothers me about Soylent. There is a lack of imagination on the part of the inventors to consider what the idea of &lt;em&gt;food replacement&lt;/em&gt; actually means. Food is a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_studies&quot;&gt;huge part of culture&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgflip.com/i/aj0ba&quot;&gt;Once cannot simply&lt;/a&gt; replace its nutritional functions and walk away scot free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Addendum: my friend &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mikearpaia/status/491875612454178816&quot;&gt;Mike asked on twitter&lt;/a&gt;, &quot;should one not solve problems when they exist?&quot; I think this is an apt question and worth an answer longer than 140 characters. In my head, this is how I think about the problem. Say you have both a terrible headache and a brain tumor. The two are likely related. For someone to come in and help you with your headache, maybe even make it go away, is not the same thing as solving the problem. You still have a brain tumor to deal with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This, crude, analogy is how I think about this larger problem of inequality in the world. Alleviating malnutrition is only part of the problem. It is certainly beyond the scope of Soylent, or any one project, to address global inequality. But my point is that thinking you&#39;re helping by fix the headache, when in fact you probably actually caused the brain tumor, isn&#39;t solving the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lest I seem to sure of myself, let me clarify that I have no idea what the right answer is. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s bad that people are trying to solve world hunger, but I do think it is bad that it often stops here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think the only thing that was novel about this movie was that it played out Shakespearean/Godfather like themes amongst Apes. That’s not enough to make a film great. Beautifully shot though, and Reeves proved himself a capable big-budget director.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What a beautiful, wonderful film. It could’ve been all about the “it took 12 years to make this movie” gimmick, but it went way beyond that. No real huge plot twists and turns, no stories to follow - except the story of life. Linklater created a narrative in the most shapeless place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m an Indian-American immigrant who grew up in New Delhi and Illinois, and this movie, about a white Texas family, feels like my story. That’s a marvelous accomplishment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Why do you have to try so hard man? Why do you have to try so hard to seem crazy?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This movie felt a lot like high school, which I suppose can be to its credit. But then I remembered - high school was full of people trying too hard because they lacked the weight of experience life.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Why I meditate and participate in endurance sports</title>
   <link href="/blog/life/why-i-meditate-and-participate-in-endurance-sports/"/>
   <updated>2014-06-09T19:03:33-04:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/life/why-i-meditate-and-participate-in-endurance-sports</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I ran my first triathlon of the season this past weekend. It was a really fun experience with new friends I&#39;ve made here in Brooklyn. I&#39;ve also been meditating with coworkers and on my own, regularly, for the last 10 plus months. I find a lot in common between these experiences. And I find them instructive for dealing with anxiety about the future, of which there is plenty among my peer group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Endurance sports like distance running, biking, swimming require a lot of mental fortitude. Completing an endurance event is as much a test of mental strength and will power as physical ability. Starting out on mile 1 of a 60 mile bike ride, or turning the corner for mile 20 of a marathon, it is easy to think about what I&#39;ll feel like when I&#39;m done. It&#39;s easy to count backward from the finish line and just convince myself that I&#39;ll keep enduring the pain until it&#39;s over. I sometimes even think the finish line will be worth it, that how crappy I feel in the moment will be rewarded in turn when I finish. But I think that&#39;s a mistake. I find it is much more rewarding to be present. I find much more satisfaction in focusing on how I feel right now. The ride, run or swim become much more calming when I can just focus on how I feel in the moment, enjoying the scenery, focusing on my breath or appreciating the pace I&#39;m keeping up. If I start playing the mental game of &quot;I only have 10 miles to go, which is 5 miles, repeated twice, which is about 30 or 35 minutes, so I should be...&quot; I know I won&#39;t enjoy myself as much. This falsely gives all the credit to the finish, when in fact the finish is only a small fraction of the activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve had similar experiences with meditation. When I first started meditating, I remember having a hard time focusing on the present. My self talk during meditation sessions would primarily be about how I might feel at the end. There was no focus on being present, on learning about the moment I was in. It took me a long time and a lot of practice to understand how to focus on my breath, on how to recognize but not fixate on fleeting thoughts. It was a difficult habit to build, but something I&#39;m glad I worked on. I still work on these habits every time I meditate, but I now understand the goal of focusing on my breath, on allowing myself to learn about my thought patterns and my proclivities through each meditation session.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have found these habits to be very helpful in alleviating anxiety in my day to day life as well. Focusing on the future, thinking about next steps, evaluating experiences in terms of future rewards can be very anxiety provoking. I have talked with peers about these feelings too, and I imagine anxiety about the future is prevalent among many people. I have tried my best to focus on the present when moments like this arise for me. Taking pleasure in the moment you&#39;re in, addressing facts and feelings as you know them now, trying your best not to count backward from some imagined future can go a long way in decreasing some of the anxiety caused by a hyper competitive, status minded, fatigue lauding world. There are a lot of things to be said about why we live in a world like this (from perspectives found in economics, sociology, psychology, philosophy, so on and so on), but that&#39;s a discussion about causes. I have found that in the mean time, this tactic of focusing on the present, can be helpful in treating at least this symptom.&lt;/p&gt;

The way he explores the city, makes connections with strangers, talks about his status in NYC as an outsider - all of these things spoke to me. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Similar to Linklater films, this book relied on voice, dialogue (internal and shared) instead of plot. I’m a fan of authors/auteurs who can pull this off. Linklater and Cole are among the best doing it right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Glad a movie actually took on and featured teenage alcoholism in a real way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During graduation one of the characters says to Sutter (the protagonist) “well, we made it.” I immediately thought about how there’s no real accomplishment mile-markers like that after high school and college graduation. As an adult, things just happen in sequence, with no real sense of separation or accomplishment. I think this makes decision making as an adult more difficult. Not a new thought of course, but a feeling this movie stirred in me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kind of reminded me of Soderbergh’s earlier explorations of sex and sexuality in SEX, LIES, AND VIDEOTAPE but with a more contemporary, OCEAN’S 11-y approach. This was sex for the MTV generation. SEX, LIES, and VIDEOTAPE was a more cerebral exploration or sex. Still, fun to see what a good director can do with otherwise mediocre material, acting, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Douglas Hofstadter's unrelenting quest to replicate the human mind</title>

   <id>/blog/commentary%20on%20works/social%20science/technology/douglas-hofstadters-unrelenting-quest-to-replicate-the-human-mind</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;Douglas Hofstadter&#39;s unrelenting quest to replicate the human mind&quot; href=&quot;http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/print/2013/11/the-man-who-would-teach-machines-to-think/309529/?src=longreads&quot;&gt;Douglas Hofstadter&#39;s unrelenting quest to replicate the human mind&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was first introduced to Douglas Hofstadter by my friend Ashok who is a student of the history of science. Over dinner one night he told me that I should read &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/G%C3%B6del-Escher-Bach-Eternal-Golden/dp/0465026567/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1383523589&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;keywords=godel+escher+bach&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Godel, Escher and Bach&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. I was in a period of devouring anything and everything that was recommended to me and after whetting my appetite with some journal articles and &lt;a href=&quot;http://ssp11si.stanford.edu/geb-syllabus.pdf&quot;&gt;course syllabi&lt;/a&gt;, I dove right in. The experience I had reading GEB was very formative (others include &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/The-Technological-Society-Jacques-Ellul/dp/0394703901/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1383523953&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;keywords=ellul+technological+society&quot;&gt;Technological Society&lt;/a&gt; by Jacques Ellul and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/The-Railway-Journey-Industrialization-Century/dp/0520059298/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1383524091&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;keywords=wolfgang+schivelbusch&quot;&gt;The Railway Journey&lt;/a&gt; by Wolfgang Schivelbusch) in my relationship to scientific thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GEB was one of the first times that I was formally introduced to neuroscience and artificial intelligence. It was one of the first times I felt like I had a low barrier of entry into mathematics and science, fields from which I had long felt estranged. All of this is a testament to Hofstadter&#39;s writing and ultimately the core idea in his book. Hofstadter sets out to make a case that intelligence and consciousness are made from the seemingly disparate building blocks of cognition. He uses math, visual art, music, puzzles and fictional narrative to demonstrate some universalities in intelligence and consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So when I came across a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/print/2013/11/the-man-who-would-teach-machines-to-think/309529/?src=longreads&quot;&gt;piece about Hofstadter&lt;/a&gt; in the Atlantic earlier this week, my interest was piqued. I haven&#39;t really heard or read much about him since GEB and I&#39;ve always been curious why such a great contribution has had so little follow up. And this piece in the Atlantic makes it very clear why this is the case: Hofstadter has no interest in advancing artificial intelligence as a field in the direction it is headed in now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To boil a long piece down to its basic idea, Hofstadter stands at one end of AI research where he and his research group are not interested in imitating how the mind works, but in understanding how the mind works. They&#39;re not happy with replicating some cognitive process with a computer and calling it a victory. On the other end of the spectrum are people like Peter Norvig and Stuart Russell who are interested in outsourcing cognitive processes to AI with no real concern for replicating exactly how that process may or may not happen in the human brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Appetite: re-whetted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On October 16, 2013 I participated in an Ignite event at Etsy. 12 of my colleagues and I got 5 minutes, 20 auto-advancing slides and the attention of a room-full of our friends and colleagues to tell a story. I talked about why I think it&#39;s important to spend time getting outside of your domain of expertise and learning new things, from the arts for example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really enjoyed putting words and order to my thoughts on this subject. If you&#39;ve followed my Twitter feed at any point in time, you can tell me affinity for all different domains of knowledge. Here&#39;s to more years of consumption, production, exploration and expansion.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>PETER NORVIG RESPONDS TO CHOMSKY</title>
   <link href="/blog/commentary%20on%20works/data%20science/social%20science/technology/peter-norvig-responds-to-chomsky/"/>
   <updated>2013-10-13T20:52:08-04:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/commentary%20on%20works/data%20science/social%20science/technology/peter-norvig-responds-to-chomsky</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://samarthbhaskar.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/screen-shot-2013-10-13-at-10-48-45-pm1.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot; wp-image aligncenter&quot; id=&quot;i-1005&quot; alt=&quot;Image&quot; src=&quot;assets/screen-shot-2013-10-13-at-10-48-45-pm1.png?w=650&quot; width=&quot;585&quot; height=&quot;413&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peter Norvig in a response to Noam Chomsky, wrote a &lt;a href=&quot;http://norvig.com/chomsky.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;lengthy essay&lt;/a&gt; on his blog. In it he described and engaged with Chomsky&#39;s claim that &quot;researchers in machine learning who use purely statistical methods to produce behavior that mimics something in the world, but who don&#39;t try to understand the meaning of that behavior.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In so doing, Norvig provided some great examples of statistical models can and cannot do. Before he approached the ultimate question, &quot;are models that try to approximate meaning in language using statistics useful?&quot;, he set up a pretty great explanation of the ways in which statistical models are used. Some key passages are below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While talking about the inferential power of statistical models, Norvig took the example of the ideal gas law (&lt;em&gt;P = N k T / V&lt;/em&gt;). About this model Norvig says&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;This model ignores that complexity and summarizes our uncertainty about the location of individual molecules. Thus, even though it is statistical and probabilistic, even though it does not completely model reality, it does provide both good predictions and insight—insight that is not available from trying to understand the true movements of individual molecules. I think this is a great way to separate what models can and cannot do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later, Norvig makes an engineering, or performance based, case for statistical linguistic models instead of logical ones, which I thought was interesting but somewhat missed the point of what Chomsky&#39;s original complaint was. None the less, he finishes out the blog post by approaching the scientific premise upon which Chomsky built his argument and engaging with that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Norvig suggests that Chomsky&#39;s argument or theory is categorical, and cannot account for gradience like a statistical model can. Even a naive Markov-chain model can be graded according to the probability or extreme-improbability of a sentence or phrase occurring. This gives far more power for insight than the type of logical model that Chomsky might embrace. Norvig says &quot;Chomsky&#39;s theory, being categorical, cannot make this distinction; all it can distinguish is grammatical/ungrammatical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final portion of this article is the most interesting to me. In it, Norvig describes and gives some of his thoughts on the two cultures of modeling: data modeling and algorithmic modeling. The section is too long to quote here, but I highly recommend it.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>'I've Got Nothing to Hide' and Other Misunderstandings of Privacy</title>
   <link href="/blog/ive-got-nothing-to-hide-and-other-misunderstandings-of-privacy/"/>

   <id>/blog/ive-got-nothing-to-hide-and-other-misunderstandings-of-privacy</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://samarthbhaskar.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/nsa-logo.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image aligncenter&quot; id=&quot;i-982&quot; alt=&quot;Image&quot; src=&quot;assets/nsa-logo.jpg?w=650&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just came across this paper on SSRN, titled&lt;a href=&quot;http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=998565&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt; &#39;I&#39;ve got Nothing to Hide&#39; and other Misunderstandings of Privacy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. It&#39;s a short essay from 2007-2008 that succinctly situates one part of the privacy discussion. More than anything else, I was drawn toward reading it because it directly addresses an argument I found myself making a lot in the last few months regarding the NSA, Prizm, and other government data collection efforts that made national news.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some key take aways from the paper that made me change my mind about making the &quot;I don&#39;t have anything to hide&quot; argument are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&quot;Far too often, discussions of the NSA surveillance and data mining define the problem solely in terms of surveillance. To return to my discussion of metaphor, the problems are not just Orwellian, but Kafkaesque. The NSA programs are problematic even if no information people want to hide is uncovered. In &lt;i&gt;The Trial&lt;/i&gt;, the problem is not inhibited behavior, but rather a suffocating powerlessness and vulnerability created by the court system’s use of personal data and its exclusion of the protagonist from having any knowledge or participation in the process.&quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&quot;[The privacy issue] is not about whether the information gathered is something people want to hide, but rather about the power and the structure of government.&quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&quot;One of the difficulties with the nothing to hide argument is that it looks for a visceral kind of injury as opposed to a structural one. &quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My proclivities as a millennial, whose political world view was largely formed by September 11th, led me astray on this matter it seems. I found myself erring on the side of &quot;well my personal discomfort, if any, will most likely be relegated to embarrassment at worst, and in exchange for increased national security, maybe it&#39;s a worthwhile trade.&quot; (or some bastardized version of that argument) But having someone lay the entire privacy question out, define privacy (a difficult endeavor in itself) and address the fact that saying &quot;I have nothing to hide,&quot; almost entirely misses the point was beneficial. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In March of this year I was invited back by my graduate program, &lt;a href=&quot;http://mapss.uchicago.edu/&quot;&gt;MAPSS&lt;/a&gt;, at the University of Chicago to give a short talk and sit on student panels about career development. The event ended up being a really great way to tie together some of the disparate pieces of my career trajectory thus far. I enjoyed giving the talk and especially talking to all the students I met afterward about their varied interests, my interests and all the ways in which we hope to contribute to the world, academically and professionally after obtaining our masters degrees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&#39;s the talk I gave about my, albeit short, career so far. What I&#39;ve learned, how I got here and what I urged students to think about. As I mention at the beginning of the talk, these are things I&#39;m still thinking about and figuring out for myself, so this talk was less prescriptive and more an opener to a conversation with students who are also thinking and figuring these things out for themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Addendum: I wrote a longer post about my experience at MAPSS, you can find that &lt;a href=&quot;http://samarthbhaskar.wordpress.com/2014/07/29/a-few-words-about-my-experience-at-mapss-uchicago/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt; re-read March 2016 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Pastoralia&lt;/i&gt;, George Saunders’ very funny, often sad, mostly easy to read, collection of short stories is a great addition to any MBA reading list. An odd suggestion, perhaps, but one that will prepare future office workers and corporatists for a life of frustrating middle management. Saunders is a chronicler of the middle manager, or of a management ethos very particular to late stage American capitalism. I’ve never lived a life outside of late stage capitalism, so I can’t say for sure, but something about Saunders’ writing - his painting of mostly frustrated, stunted, men living lives of quiet desperation - fits very well with my experience of people I’ve known in the working world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A lot of us have been sold the dream, often by the sneakiest of sales-people, our parents and loved ones, that we’re meant for greatness. Instead, most of us find ourselves among other average people. This mismatch makes for fertile ground for a story teller like Saunders. He captures the inner rage of a barber, the fear and shame of an unnamed narrator working in a cave man theme park, the longing of a dead all-to-nice aunt, or people in self-help groups. Some inner working in all these characters made me believe they all had bigger plans, and were left instead to deal with the life they were actually living.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If there wasn’t this mismatch of how amazing we all think we are and how average most of us turn out to be, would Saunders have much to write about? I’m sure he’d find something. But as long as the world works as it does, we have the benefit of having a writer like George Saunders hold a mirror up to ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>H.L. Mencken and Pixar's RATATOUILLE on criticism</title>
   <link href="/blog/commentary%20on%20works/culture%20and%20society/movies/h-l-mencken-and-pixars-ratatouille-on-criticism/"/>
   <updated>2013-01-27T10:56:01-05:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/commentary%20on%20works/culture%20and%20society/movies/h-l-mencken-and-pixars-ratatouille-on-criticism</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I remember after I saw &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0382932/&quot;&gt;Ratatouille&lt;/a&gt; in 2007, I was thinking a lot about criticism and the role of critics in the art landscape. Without spoiling much, a pivotal character in the film is Anton Ego, the food critic who is known to be impressed by nothing but holds Parisian attention hostage on the matter of the best food in Paris. Ego (a moniker that deserves consideration in itself; Is he consumed by his own conception of himself? Were the writers commenting perhaps on Freudian concept of the ego, or maybe even Lacanian concepts? Who knows) is vilified throughout the entire film but ends up being the final release we get as an audience, when he falls in love with our chefs Remi and Linguini&#39;s cooking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the time of viewing, I remember thinking - what in the world gave Ego (or critics at large) such power that he gets to decide what is or isn&#39;t good art? Why isn&#39;t art democratic? What about the hundreds of people who love the art that Remy and Linguini (or artists) create? Since then I&#39;ve had a number of conversations with friends about the role of criticism in society. And I&#39;ve even had periods where I&#39;ll only read a particular film or literature critic, or swear off of criticism all together, or some combination in between.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, I ran across &lt;a href=&quot;http://vserver1.cscs.lsa.umich.edu/~crshalizi/Mencken/criticism-of-criticism-of-criticism/&quot;&gt;this essay by H.L. Mencken&lt;/a&gt; (who, in interest of full disclosure, I was first introduced to because of the ending quote on the last episode of THE WIRE). In it, he introduces a pretty compelling definition of and case for criticism. This snippet summed it up well for me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;address&gt;It is [the critic&#39;s] business to provoke the reaction between the work of art and the spectator. The spectator, untutored, stands unmoved; he sees the work of art, but it fails to make any intelligible impression on him; if he were spontaneously sensitive to it, there would be no need for criticism. But now comes the critic with his catalysis. He makes the work of art live for the spectator; he makes the spectator live for the work of art. Out of the process comes understanding, appreciation, intelligent enjoyment --- and that is precisely what the artist tried to produce.&lt;/address&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&#39;t know if I&#39;ve come across too many such critics, at least in the areas of art that I access all the time (books, films, music). However, when I do come across such critical works, they become very meaningful very quickly. I don&#39;t know if Ego in Ratatouille ever gave us this, but perhaps the sequence of him remembering his childhood and his mother&#39;s cooking was the closest we got.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the controversy surrounding the Allen Ginsburg poem &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.poets.org/viewmedia.php/prmMID/15308&quot;&gt;Howl&lt;/a&gt;&quot;, one critic on the witness stand when asked about the meaning of specific words or sentences in the poem said something like &quot;well, that&#39;s why poetry is poetry. It&#39;s not prose. It can&#39;t easily be explained in prose.&quot; I think that&#39;s what a good critic can sometimes do. S/he can turn poetry into prose.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;blockquote&gt;Scientists — even the hardest of scientists — fabricate data, fabricate studies, fall prey to fads, and otherwise get things wrong. But more relevantly, they just don’t know that much. We have very little idea of how the body works; the pills we take are made through the bluntest of means. We don’t know how to calculate very simple things, like the dispersion of milk in a cup of coffee. The illusion that social science is ineffective can only be sustained by ignorance of such ineffectiveness of hard science. The upside of all this is that there is hope for social science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many people have written and spoken much more poignant words about Aaron Swartz&#39;s passing over the weekend. I never knew him, and was only familiar with his work in passing. But, for good reason, I found myself reading a lot about him over the weekend and I found this &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/socialscience&quot;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; from 2005 on his website particularly compelling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For such a short piece about the nature and state of the social sciences, Swartz really packed a punch. These are thoughts that I&#39;ve thought and talked about many times before, but this piece is a great articulation of them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an effort to not mystify Aaron&#39;s work and contributions, I find this sort of thing to be something I can do to help. I can look through his body of work, look up to his example and do my best to find my calling in the quest to bring the social sciences, and specifically the empirical social sciences, to serve society. Rest in piece Aaron. &lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Junot Diaz - as impactful when he speaks as when he writes</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2VznOkJUJY&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Junot Diaz, author of the highly acclaimed &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Drown-Junot-Diaz/dp/1573226068/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1355470859&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;keywords=drown&quot;&gt;Drown&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Brief-Wondrous-Life-Oscar-Wao/dp/1594483299/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1355470911&amp;amp;sr=1-1&amp;amp;keywords=brief+wondrous+life+of+oscar+wao&quot;&gt;The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao&lt;/a&gt; and the recently released &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/This-How-You-Lose-Her/dp/1594487367/ref=sr_1_7?s=books&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1355470911&amp;amp;sr=1-7&amp;amp;keywords=brief+wondrous+life+of+oscar+wao&quot;&gt;This is How You Lose Her&lt;/a&gt;, is amazingly eloquent as a speaker. He carries over his intelligence, charm, wit, humor, empathy and insight from the page to the interview set quite seamlessly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have watched a handful of really interesting interviews with Diaz discussing his experiences as a writer, an academic, a cultural critic and all the various roles he has taken on in his life. A common thread between all of the clips is his ability to construct a thought with precision and insight that is emblematic of a highly matured thought process. He hardly fails, even in sentences that seem to be off-the-cuff or filler, to convey a cogent and considered thought. After spending a year surrounded by mainstream political rhetoric, which even at its finest can be less than evocative and often repeats familiar patterns, I am perhaps more impressed than an average viewer with Diaz&#39;s oratory. It also doesn&#39;t hurt that I&#39;ve devoured his writing in the last few years and thought highly of him as a cultural icon for hyphenated-Americans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None the less, I hope to learn from him. Learn to speak as deeply as I think. Maybe I should start by thinking deeply first.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Causality in Political Networks</title>
   <link href="/blog/books/data%20science/rajaraman-and-ullmans-mining-of-massive-datasets/"/>
   <updated>2012-11-24T13:35:52-05:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/books/data%20science/rajaraman-and-ullmans-mining-of-massive-datasets</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A 2011 paper in &lt;em&gt;American Politics Research&lt;/em&gt; titled &quot;Causality in Political Networks&quot; discusses some important concerns about assigning causality to social network analysis studies, especially when it comes to political behavior and preferences. The basic definition of causality adopted by the authors is one put forward by Henry Brady in 2008 that basically says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;causal arguments are stronger to the extent that they demonstrate  our elements: (a) “constant conjunction of causes and effects”; (b)  No effect when the cause is absent in the most similar world to where the cause is present”; (c) “An effect after a cause is manipulated”; and (d)  The identification of “Activities and processes [i.e., mechanisms] linking causes and effects” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors then go on to discuss, in five short essays, how causality may be assessed through social network analysis. From survey data, field experiments, socio-centric data to measurement errors and study-design, this paper is a pretty good place to start when thinking about how you can move past descriptive analysis to something closer to causal inference in social network analysis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the sake of disclosure: one of the authors of this paper is my former graduate advisor. Another was a professor during graduate school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citation: &lt;b&gt;Causality in Political Networks. Fowler et al.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;i&gt;American Politics Research &lt;/i&gt;2011 39: 437. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drew Conway (hacker, data-scientist, political-scientist, and pseudo-data-celebrity) gave this great talk recently at a conference that I enjoyed. He talks about the intersection of the data-sciences (hacking + statistics) and the social sciences. Drew, whose book &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Machine-Learning-Hackers-Drew-Conway/dp/1449303714&quot;&gt;Machine Learning for Hackers&lt;/a&gt;, I enjoyed a lot is a great example of someone who is bringing the tools of computer science and data-science to bear on an unrelated (at first glance) field, the social sciences.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>David Foster Wallace on Kafka's Humor</title>
   <link href="/blog/books/commentary%20on%20works/culture%20and%20society/david-foster-wallace-on-kafkas-humor/"/>
   <updated>2011-10-12T17:25:54-04:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/books/commentary%20on%20works/culture%20and%20society/david-foster-wallace-on-kafkas-humor</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Consider the Lobster &lt;/em&gt;David Foster Wallace has a short essay titled &quot;Some Remarks on Kafka&#39;s Funniness From Which Probably Not Enough Has Been Removed,&quot; in which he presents his case for reading humor in Kafka and how he tried to teach his students to do this when teaching Kafka. I liked this passage at the end and wanted to share it&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s not that students don&#39;t &quot;get&quot; Kafka&#39;s humor but that we&#39;ve taught them to see humor as something you &lt;em&gt;get&lt;/em&gt; - the same way we&#39;ve taught them that a self is something you just &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt;. No wonder they cannot appreciate the really center Kafka joke: that the horrific struggle to establish a human self results in a self whose humanity is inseparable from that horrific struggle. That our endless and impossible journey toward home is in fact our home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rest of the essays in the collection are great too. Some personal favorites include &quot;How Tracy Austin Broke My Heart,&quot; &quot;Authority and American Usage,&quot; and &quot;Certainly the End of &lt;em&gt;Something&lt;/em&gt; or Other, One Would Sort of Have to Think.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Bayesian methods in applied econometrics</title>
   <link href="/blog/commentary%20on%20works/economics/social%20science/talks/bayesian-methods-in-applied-econometrics/"/>
   <updated>2011-10-11T13:36:31-04:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/commentary%20on%20works/economics/social%20science/talks/bayesian-methods-in-applied-econometrics</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Christopher Simms, of recent &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-10-10/sargent-sims-share-2011-nobel-in-economics.html&quot;&gt;Nobel fame&lt;/a&gt;, has a&lt;a href=&quot;http://sims.princeton.edu/yftp/EmetSoc607/AppliedBayes.pdf&quot;&gt; presentation&lt;/a&gt; [pdf] up on his website from 2007 that is a pretty good introduction to the difference between frequentist and Bayesian approaches to economics, and ultimately why a Bayesian approach is most prudent for economists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This from his introduction sets up the basic premises of his presentation -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Introduction&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The ﬁrst part of the talk makes some unoriginal claims about the role of Bayesian thinking.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Despite being unoriginal, and obvious to me and to a minority of econometricians, they are unfamiliar, thought-provoking, or outrageous to quite a few econometricians.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A summer seminar talk seems a good place to restate claims that are both obvious and outrageous and that therefore (for one of these reasons or the other) are usually excluded from journal articles.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The latter part of the talk discusses some areas of econometric application where frequentist asymptotics seems particularly persistent and suggests how Bayesian approaches might become more practical and prevalent.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Although I&#39;m not entirely comfortable with Bayesian statistics, this was an interesting presentation to read none the less. I plan on referring back to this in the future when I come across some decisions about methodology for research projects.&lt;/div&gt;

   <title>Blogging as a bridge between academia and public sphere</title>
   <link href="/blog/commentary%20on%20works/economics/international%20relations/social%20science/blogging-as-a-bridge-between-academia-and-public-sphere/"/>
   <updated>2011-09-02T09:49:40-04:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/commentary%20on%20works/economics/international%20relations/social%20science/blogging-as-a-bridge-between-academia-and-public-sphere</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Harvard political scientist Stephen Walt &lt;a href=&quot;http://publicsphere.ssrc.org/walt-international-affairs-and-the-public-sphere/&quot;&gt;wrote an essay&lt;/a&gt; on the role of international affairs academics in the public sphere. Not the first of its kind of course, but this essay is a pretty thorough description of the state of the two arenas (academia and policy/public sphere) and how they do not co-exist nearly as much as they should. Walt is speaking as an international relations scholar, but his complaints and recommendations could probably span across academic disciplines (perhaps with the exception of the natural sciences, since people don&#39;t have as many intuitions about how quantum mechanics or gene therapy works on which to  base their biases).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The essay is worth a read, if for no other reason, to get an idea of the relationship between the academy and the public sphere over the course of modern history. Among the many suggestions Walt outlines to remedy this broken relationship, he suggests that popular writing (op-eds, articles in newspapers and magazines, blogs, etc) should not be looked down upon within the academy. On the suggestion of blogs, this working paper &lt;a href=&quot;http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/IW3P/IB/2011/08/29/000158349_20110829130036/Rendered/PDF/WPS5783.pdf&quot;&gt;[PDF]&lt;/a&gt; by the World Bank comes to mind. In it, the impact of popular economics blogs is assessed through various experimental and non-experimental means.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The paper offers 3 main take-aways:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Links from blogs cause a striking increase in abstract views or downloads of economics papers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Blogging raises the profile of the blogger (and his or her institution) and boosts their reputation above economists with similar publication records.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Blogs can transform attitudes about some of the topics they cover.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Edit on September 14, 2011 at 4pm (central): Here are two other( &lt;a href=&quot;http://publicsphere.ssrc.org/smith-political-science-and-the-public-sphere/&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://publicsphere.ssrc.org/anderson-international-affairs-political-science-and-the-public-sphere/&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;) papers from &lt;a href=&quot;http://publicsphere.ssrc.org/initiative-academia-public-sphere/&quot;&gt;this conference&lt;/a&gt; where Walt will be presenting the paper above. May be of interest in addition to this Walt paper.&lt;/div&gt;

   <title>Ed Glaeser on the nascent social sciences</title>
   <link href="/blog/commentary%20on%20works/social%20science/ed-glaeser-on-the-nascent-social-sciences/"/>
   <updated>2011-09-01T15:24:03-04:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/commentary%20on%20works/social%20science/ed-glaeser-on-the-nascent-social-sciences</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Harvard economist Ed Glaeser writes cogently in this article in Harvard magazine about how nascent the social sciences really are. Formal modeling and reliance on data driven research has only been the case for social scientists for less than a century. In the grand scheme of knowledge production and academic progress, this is not very long at all. Glaeser&#39;s article is worth the short read, but here are some passages worth quoting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;As data quality has improved, social scientists have moved beyond facts and correlations to the deeper quest for causality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good social-science experimental research first proliferated in psychology labs. Economists followed the psychologists by creating labs that tested (and often rejected) the predictions that game theory made concerning behavior in markets and auctions. But there is only so much that laboratory experiments can teach us about the long-term impact of having good neighbors or the functioning of a large, real market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The adoption of experimental methods and improved data quality have, in turn, helped generate the third major social-science trend—the increasing irrelevance of traditional field boundaries. Empirical approaches are far more likely than theoretical edifices to be common across fields.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Social science is changing rapidly, as better data and real experiments replace the worldly philosophy of the past. Yet that change means that nineteenth-century field definitions feel increasingly obsolete.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

   <title>Commanding Heights - PBS Documentary</title>
   <link href="/blog/commentary%20on%20works/economics/international%20relations/movies/politics/commanding-heights-pbs-documentary/"/>
   <updated>2011-08-31T13:00:45-04:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/commentary%20on%20works/economics/international%20relations/movies/politics/commanding-heights-pbs-documentary</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Last week I watched all three episodes of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/commandingheights/&quot;&gt;Commanding Heights&lt;/a&gt;, a 2002 PBS documentary based off of a book by Daniel Yergin and Joseph Stanislaw titled &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Commanding-Heights-Government-Marketplace-Remaking/dp/0684829754/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1314815039&amp;amp;sr=8-1&quot;&gt;The Commanding Heights: The Battle Between Government and the Marketplace That Is Remaking the Modern World&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;The documentary was presented in three, 2-h0ur long episodes that discussed the development of the modern global economic system. The subject matter could easily double as a doctoral dissertation or an academic sub-discipline of its own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Episode 1: The Battle of Ideas&lt;/strong&gt; takes an in-depth look at John Maynard Keynes and Friedrich von Hayek as two competing yet highly influential economists post World War I. The episode features depictions of Keynesianism&#39;s rise to prominence in the middle part of the 20th century, the ascendence of communism, the establishment of Chicago-school economists in the US and finally the development of market-oriented policy under Reagan in the US and Thatcher in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Episode 2: The Agony of Reform&lt;/strong&gt; starts out by showing global economic downturns in both Western democratic and communist countries. Mostly working to highlight the failure of centrally planned economies, this episode shows the struggle that many (if not all economies) went through to transition toward privatization and moving away from Keynes toward Hayek. &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shock_therapy_(economics)&quot;&gt;Jeff Sach&#39;s &quot;shock therapy&quot;&lt;/a&gt; is centrally featured, as is the fall of the USSR and the emergence of post-Soviet bloc states.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Episode 3: The New Rules of the Game&lt;/strong&gt; delves into concepts and issues in globalization. Unequal distribution of resources and wealth are highlighted as the episode wanders through the rise and fall of the Asian Tiger economies, troubles in Mexico, concerns of labor unions who felt powerless in the United States and the Clinton administration&#39;s relentless pursuit of unfettered globalization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all, the documentary features interviews from former and current heads of state (Clinton, Thatcher, Goni, bin Mohamad), economic powerhouses (Hayek, Friedman, Sachs) , policy-makers (Rubin, Corzine) and leaders of international organizations - a veritable who&#39;s who of international political economy. If you find yourself with 6 hours to kill and an insatiable appetite for understanding how and why the global economy works as it does today, I highly recommend this documentary. In all honesty, I can&#39;t recommend this documentary highly enough. The in-depth analysis, narrative structure and highly convincing content is a must see for all students of politics, economics or the world at large. It is my contention that just as the tragedy of 9/11 created greater interest in foreign policy, military strategy and comparative politics, the economic and financial crises we&#39;re in today will be responsible for a new generation of students concerned with economic, political and global issues. It&#39;s unfortunate that it takes such tragedies to spark these interests, but with these events so prime in our minds, there is no doubt that young-people like myself will work to understand what went wrong and do our best to avoid repeating these failures in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Incidentally, this has also made me look forward to reading &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Quest-Energy-Security-Remaking-Modern/dp/1594202834/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1314816517&amp;amp;sr=8-1&quot;&gt;Yergin&#39;s newest book&lt;/a&gt; on energy, security and post-9/11 global issues.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>A literature review of the impact of the Internet on the brain</title>

   <id>/blog/commentary%20on%20works/culture%20and%20society/media%20studies/technology/a-literature-review-of-the-impact-of-the-internet-on-the-brain</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nominettrust.org.uk/soa-impact-internet-brain&quot;&gt;this report&lt;/a&gt; published by Nominet Trust out of the UK, a neuroscientist compiles the latest research in neuroscience about the impact of the Internet on our brains. As with most academic ventures, no real conclusions are drawn and lots of caveats populate the pages, but this is a well put together compilation of the state of knowledge on the subject. Below are some take aways from the executive summary that I liked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On painting with broad strokes -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rather than label any type of technology as being good or bad for our brain, it is how specific applications are created and used (by who, when and what for) that determine their impact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On offline behavior influencing online behavior -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Existing forms of online communication for supporting existing friendships are generally beneficial for their users, with little basis for considering that social network sites and online communication, in themselves, are a source of special risk to children. Internet-related abuse (eg inappropriate sexual solicitation, cyberbullying) appears related to issues beyond the use of the internet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On learning and the Internet -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The internet is a valuable learning resource and all learning involves changes in the brain. Some technology-based types of training can improve working memory, and others can provide mental stimulation that helps slow cognitive decline&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On sleep -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Evidence linking technology-based activity to a reduction in physical exercise is mixed, but how and when technology is used does appear to influence sleep. In particular, late night technology use is linked to reduction in sleep and sleep quality, and teenagers who use their mobile phones after “lights out” are considerably more likely to suffer daytime sleepiness. Again, games may be different from most other types of&lt;br /&gt;
technology in their influence on neurobiological processes, with some evidence that they can disrupt children’s sleep and learning even when played early in the evening&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

   <title>Disaggregating social media and civic governance theories</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://samarthbhaskar.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/delhi-police-logo.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-386&quot; title=&quot;Delhi Police Logo&quot; src=&quot;assets/delhi-police-logo.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;238&quot; height=&quot;170&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:left;&quot;&gt;&quot;In the Indian capital of New Delhi, a tiny cohort of Internet savvy consumers is demanding better services from their government and is using social media to make it happen, even though the vast majority of the town’s residents remain off the Internet&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The end of &lt;a href=&quot;http://sustainablebusinessforum.com/user/51809&quot;&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt; claims some minor successes (mostly relating to public shaming of abuses of power by the Delhi traffic police) but in the quote above, the line &quot;even though the vast majority of the town&#39;s residents remain off the Internet&quot; caught my eye.&lt;br /&gt;
I am not sure exactly what my thoughts are yet, but the difference in what demographic of a political constituency uses a social media tool versus embodied protest might be an interesting way to model social media usage for political purposes. Perhaps educated, networked, drivers in New Delhi are completely well-suited as a demographic who would use social media to air grievances. While uneducated, disenfranchised, impoverished residents might not be the right demographic to try and pose or answer questions about social media usage.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Sex, lies and overblown statistics</title>

   <id>/blog/commentary%20on%20works/economics/social%20science/sex-lies-and-overblown-statistics</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;John Kay writes in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/dfe55458-ccb6-11e0-b923-00144feabdc0.html#axzz1VvhLEcx7&quot;&gt;Financial Times&lt;/a&gt; -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Statistics are only as valid as the sources from which they are drawn and the abilities of those who use them. When I discover something surprising in data, the most common explanation is that I made a mistake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A short and worthwhile read about how to consume statistical information. Among the basic questions to ask yourself and the author are &quot;what is the question to which the number is the answer?&quot;, &quot;where does the data come from?&quot; and &quot;is an unexpected finding a feature of the data or a feature of the world?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Edit (@10:55): &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.johnkay.com/2003/05/15/political-decisions-are-not-a-matter-of-statistics&quot;&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt; on Kay&#39;s website is pretty great too. It&#39;s about political decisions and how they rarely adhere to cost-benefit analyses or statistical evidence. He wrote this in 2003, right around the time the UK was considering adopting the Euro.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Experimental design in the Social Sciences</title>
   <link href="/blog/commentary%20on%20works/economics/social%20science/experimental-design-in-the-social-sciences/"/>
   <updated>2011-08-19T08:36:49-04:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/commentary%20on%20works/economics/social%20science/experimental-design-in-the-social-sciences</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.city-journal.org/2010/20_3_social-science.html&quot;&gt;Here&#39;s a pretty cool piece&lt;/a&gt; from the City Journal by Jim Manzi from Summer 2010 talking about causal claims in the social sciences. He has a concise history of experiment design and methodology from the natural and biological sciences that plays well into the kinds of things the social sciences should be worrying about. I have always been wary of modeling the social sciences &lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt; after the natural sciences because there are obviously differences between the two that require attention, but for now, I think the natural science model of inquiry is a good one to aspire to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None the less, Manzi talks about things like randomization:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1884, the brilliant but erratic American polymath C. S. Peirce hit upon a solution when he &lt;em&gt;randomly&lt;/em&gt; assigned participants to the test and control groups. Random assignment permits a medical experimentalist to conclude reliably that differences in outcome are caused by differences in treatment. That’s because even causal differences among individuals of which the experimentalist is unaware—say, that genetic predisposition—should be roughly equally distributed between the test and control groups, and therefore not bias the result.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generalizability, or external validity:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even in classical therapeutic experiments, the assumption of uniform biological response is often a tolerable approximation that permits researchers to assert, say, that the polio vaccine that worked for a test population will also work for human beings beyond the test population. But we cannot safely assume that a literacy program that works in one school will work in all schools. Just as high causal densities in biology created the need for randomization, even higher causal densities in the social sciences create the need for even greater rigor when we try to generalize the results of an experiment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end he has three take-aways that aren&#39;t exhaustive but worth keeping in mind:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, few programs can be shown to work in properly randomized and replicated trials. Despite complex and impressive-sounding empirical arguments by advocates and analysts, we should be very skeptical of claims for the effectiveness of new, counterintuitive programs and policies, and we should be reluctant to trump the trial-and-error process of social evolution in matters of economics or social policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, within this universe of programs that are far more likely to fail than succeed, programs that try to change &lt;em&gt;people&lt;/em&gt; are even more likely to fail than those that try to change &lt;em&gt;incentives&lt;/em&gt;. A litany of program ideas designed to push welfare recipients into the workforce failed when tested in those randomized experiments of the welfare-reform era; only adding mandatory work requirements succeeded in moving people from welfare to work in a humane fashion. And mandatory work-requirement programs that emphasize just getting a job are far more effective than those that emphasize skills-building. Similarly, the list of failed attempts to change people to make them less likely to commit crimes is almost endless—prisoner counseling, transitional aid to prisoners, intensive probation, juvenile boot camps—but the only program concept that tentatively demonstrated reductions in crime rates in replicated RFTs was nuisance abatement, which changes the &lt;em&gt;environment&lt;/em&gt; in which criminals operate. (This isn’t to say that direct behavior-improvement programs can never work; one well-known program that sends nurses to visit new or expectant mothers seems to have succeeded in improving various social outcomes in replicated independent RFTs.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And third, there is no magic. Those rare programs that do work usually lead to improvements that are quite modest, compared with the size of the problems they are meant to address or the dreams of advocates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, in terms of randomized field trials, I would be remiss to not mention &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Poor-Economics-Radical-Rethinking-Poverty/dp/1586487981&quot;&gt;Banerjee and Duflo&#39;s &lt;em&gt;Poor Economics&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, one of the best popular titles I&#39;ve read coming out of economics and development literature. This &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2011/04/25/more_than_1_billion_people_are_hungry_in_the_world?page=full&quot;&gt;Foreign Policy article&lt;/a&gt; is a great introduction if you don&#39;t have time to read the book.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Gary King on future data-richness in the social sciences</title>
   <link href="/blog/commentary%20on%20works/social%20science/gary-king-on-future-data-richness-in-the-social-sciences/"/>
   <updated>2011-08-13T08:47:57-04:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/commentary%20on%20works/social%20science/gary-king-on-future-data-richness-in-the-social-sciences</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Gary King (Harvard social scientist, statistician and &lt;a href=&quot;http://gking.harvard.edu/amelia/&quot;&gt;R-magician extraordinaire&lt;/a&gt;) published a piece in the journal &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt; earlier this year that provided some philosophical and methodological grounding for the future of data usage for social scientific inference. In it he puts forth the idea that social science is at the cusp of the ability to study human society as never before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analogous to what it must have been like when they first handed out microscopes to microbiologists, social scientists are getting to the point in many areas at which enough information exists to understand and address major previously intractable problems that affect human society.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;King, correctly in my opinion, supports the idea that if privacy is adequately protected we can take advantage of new (sometimes digital, sometimes not) data, facilitate data sharing and replication and gain inferential powers that have hardly been seen in our field. The whole piece is worth reading (much shorter and much more consumable than most academic articles) and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://gking.harvard.edu/files/datarich.pdf&quot;&gt;PDF link is provided here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a tangential note, with the recent controversy over illegal spread and usage of academic articles, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2011/jul/21/aaron-swartz-indicted-hacking-charges&quot;&gt;namely the arrest of Aaron Swartz&lt;/a&gt;, I think one solution might be for researchers to publish their pieces on their personal/professional websites. This might come with some backlash from journals and I&#39;m not exactly sure what the ownership rights over a published piece in a journal are, but most researchers have their own sites these days, and this might serve as a good compromise until we can &lt;a href=&quot;http://thinkprogress.org/yglesias/2011/07/20/273897/academic-work-should-be-distributed-for-free/&quot;&gt;figure out a better solut&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://thinkprogress.org/yglesias/2011/07/20/273897/academic-work-should-be-distributed-for-free/&quot;&gt;ion.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Edit: Here&#39;s a great &lt;a href=&quot;http://techheads.tv/diavlogs/37866&quot;&gt;Techheads.tv with Julian Sanchez and Timothy B. Lee&lt;/a&gt; about the Aaron Swartz controversy, and IP issues at large.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Podcast: Darren Acemoglu on inequality and the financial crisis</title>
   <link href="/blog/commentary%20on%20works/economics/talks/podcast-darren-acemoglu-on-inequality-and-the-financial-crisis/"/>
   <updated>2011-08-13T07:40:38-04:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/commentary%20on%20works/economics/talks/podcast-darren-acemoglu-on-inequality-and-the-financial-crisis</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;After reading Darren Acemoglu, MIT economist, in the Harvard Business Review the other day on the topic of &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.hbr.org/cs/2011/08/the_real_solution_is_growth.html&quot;&gt;threats to growth in the United States&lt;/a&gt;, I ran across this &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.econtalk.org/archives/2011/02/acemoglu_on_ine.html&quot;&gt;podcast&lt;/a&gt; with him from earlier this year. In it, he takes on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Fault-Lines-Fractures-Threaten-Economy/dp/0691146837/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1313242436&amp;amp;sr=8-1&quot;&gt;Raghuram Rajan&#39;s main argument &lt;/a&gt;that&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Fault-Lines-Fractures-Threaten-Economy/dp/0691146837/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1313242436&amp;amp;sr=8-1&quot;&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;growing income inequality in the last part of the 20th century created a political demand for redistribution and various policy changes. This in turn created the push for higher home ownership rates and led to the distortions of the housing market that in turn led to excessive risk-taking in the financial market. Acemoglu suggests a simpler story where the financial sector through its political influence distorted the rules of the game, benefiting executives in the industry, which in turn led to outsized rewards and ultimate instability in the financial industry. The conversation discusses ways of distinguishing between these two arguments and what might be done to change the incentives of politicians.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The clarity with which Acemoglu explains his argument is worthy of the hour spent listening to the podcast, in itself. Add to that, the argument that Acemoglu is putting forward and its focus on political institutions rather than consumer behavior is much more in line with some of my concerns regarding the crisis. Well, I should be less sensationalist here. Acemoglu takes on the idea of differentiating between the two (political institutions and consumer behavior) rather than one of the other. None the less, in the never ending stream of punditry and waxing on and on about the financial crisis, I found this to be one of the better hours I spent.&lt;/p&gt;

   <id>/blog/commentary%20on%20works/politics/social%20science/better-analysts-better-data-better-theory-all-of-the-above</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Harvard Business Review has a &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.hbr.org/cs/2011/08/success_comes_from_better_data.html?cm_sp=blog_flyout-_-cs-_-success_comes_from_better_data&quot;&gt;new blog post&lt;/a&gt; up by Daryl Morey, the General Manager of the Houston Rockets, in which he argues that with a market teeming with better and better analysts, its not the skills of these analysts that will be the future of successful quantitative analysis, but instead the quality of data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The answer is better data. Yep, that&#39;s right. Raw numbers, not the people and programs that attempt to make sense of them. Many organizations have spent the last few years hiring top analysts based on the belief that they create differentiation. Smart companies such as Google believe they need savants to crunch those numbers and find the connections that regular humans could not. But my experience, and what I&#39;m hearing from more organizations (sports and non), shows that real advantage comes from unique data that no one else has.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m not so convinced. I think we&#39;re headed toward an age of a&lt;a href=&quot;http://quantifiedself.com/about/&quot;&gt; quantifiable&lt;/a&gt; representation of a majority of our world. So, in some ways, I am on board with Morey&#39;s call for higher quality data. But I believe that will be almost inevitable. What I would like to see is better theory applied to analyze this data, for &lt;a href=&quot;http://data.worldbank.org/&quot;&gt;data to be open&lt;/a&gt; for use and analysis by experts and non-experts alike and for the inferences that are drawn on the data to be put toward actionable results (in my field of interest, toward smarter policy).&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Bayesian statistics in the NYT</title>
   <link href="/blog/books/commentary%20on%20works/social%20science/bayesian-statistics-in-the-nyt/"/>
   <updated>2011-08-08T16:42:30-04:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/books/commentary%20on%20works/social%20science/bayesian-statistics-in-the-nyt</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The NYT has a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/07/books/review/the-theory-that-would-not-die-by-sharon-bertsch-mcgrayne-book-review.html?ref=books&amp;amp;pagewanted=all&quot;&gt;book review&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Theory-That-Would-Not-Die/dp/0300169698/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1312843023&amp;amp;sr=8-1&quot;&gt;THE THEORY THAT WOULD NOT DIE&lt;/a&gt;: How Bayes’ Rule Cracked the Enigma Code, Hunted Down Russian Submarines and Emerged Triumphant From Two Centuries of Controversy, a new book by Sharon Bertsch McGrayne. I have not read the book, but the article is a good introduction to the Bayesian approach to statistical analysis, or at least what it claims to do in theory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The theorem itself can be stated simply. Beginning with a provisional hypothesis about the world (there are, of course, no other kinds), we assign to it an initial probability called the prior probability or simply the prior. After actively collecting or happening upon some potentially relevant evidence, we use Bayes’s theorem to recalculate the probability of the hypothesis in light of the new evidence. This revised probability is called the posterior probability or simply the posterior. Specifically Bayes’s theorem states (trumpets sound here) that the posterior probability of a hypothesis is equal to the product of (a) the prior probability of the hypothesis and (b) the conditional probability of the evidence given the hypothesis, divided by (c) the probability of the new evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider a concrete example. Assume that you’re presented with three coins, two of them fair and the other a counterfeit that always lands heads. If you randomly pick one of the three coins, the probability that it’s the counterfeit is 1 in 3. This is the prior probability of the hypothesis that the coin is counterfeit. Now after picking the coin, you flip it three times and observe that it lands heads each time. Seeing this new evidence that your chosen coin has landed heads three times in a row, you want to know the revised posterior probability that it is the counterfeit. The answer to this question, found using Bayes’s theorem (calculation mercifully omitted), is 4 in 5. You thus revise your probability estimate of the coin’s being counterfeit upward from 1 in 3 to 4 in 5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

4) Produce&lt;br /&gt;
5) Seek Discomfort&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m hoping to bring these skills to bear on future research and job opportunities, so I can advance not only my ability to draw inferences on data (social, political, or otherwise) but also present the data and my inferences more skillfully.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>My 11 favorite ESPN 30 for 30s</title>
   <link href="/blog/commentary%20on%20works/culture%20and%20society/tv/my-11-favorite-espn-30-for-30s/"/>
   <updated>2011-07-21T17:19:08-04:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/commentary%20on%20works/culture%20and%20society/tv/my-11-favorite-espn-30-for-30s</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://samarthbhaskar.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/30for30.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-355&quot; title=&quot;30for30&quot; src=&quot;assets/30for30.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;224&quot; height=&quot;145&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recently finished watching all 30 &lt;a href=&quot;http://30for30.espn.com/&quot;&gt;ESPN 30 for 30s&lt;/a&gt; and enjoyed them a lot more than I expected. The biggest thing I took away from them is that sports are quite closely tied to a lot of social phenomenon. The films, on their own, are also remarkable because each is made by a different film-maker, artist or athlete. Below is a list of my 11 favorite 30 for 30s with a short description or editorial comment on each. They aren&#39;t in ascending or descending order, just 11 favorites from the 30. A nod of the proverbial hat goes to my friend Darryl for recommending most of these as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Two Escobars&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left:30px;&quot;&gt;Pablo Escobar, arguably the world&#39;s most famous drug lord, had an unmatched passion for Columbian soccer and the soccer world had a conflicted relationship with him. The title can be taken to mean the two Escobars as in Andres Escobar, the star of the Columbian national team, or the two sides of Pablo Escobar: philanthropist and drug/war lord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:left;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Once Brothers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left:30px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Vlade Divac and Dražen Petrović had remarkable rises to fame in the NBA after playing together as teenagers in Yugoslavia. Political and ethnic tensions in their home country found their way into their once strong friendship. Petrovic died an untimely death in a car-accident and Divac retraces the roots of their friendship in this documentary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Pony Excess&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left:30px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Many have complained about college athletics taking attention away from academics or being tainted with poor ethics through bribery or monetary incentives for college athletes. This documentary takes Southern Methodist University in Dallas, Texas as a case study to explore college football&#39;s excesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. &lt;strong&gt;No Crossover: The Trial of Allen Iverson&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left:30px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;A racially charged story about Allen Iverson&#39;s involvement in a 1993 bowling alley brawl. Made by a resident of Hampton, Virginia where Iverson, Michael Vick and Lawrence Taylor are from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Winning Time: Reggie Miller vs. The New York Knicks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left:30px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;This was probably the most entertaining documentary of them all. Reggie Miller&#39;s antics on the court, Spike Lee&#39;s antics on the sideline and the drama that unfolded over multiple playoff series all make for a great story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. Straight Outta L.A.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left:30px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;The co-evolution of the L.A. raiders and gangster rap in L.A. The focus on the Raider logo and merchandise was especially interesting. Design and PR folks could probably draw one example after another out of this documentary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7. Without Bias&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left:30px;&quot;&gt;I didn&#39;t know much about Len Bias before watching this documentary. His career as a high school phenomenon, college star and first-round draft into the NBA all came to an end at his death following his cocaine use. The scenes featuring his mother and father were especially powerful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8. The U&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left:30px;&quot;&gt;Usually, unbridled showboating and bragging are a turn off. I&#39;ve always associated Miami with this kind of behavior. This documentary didn&#39;t change my judgment about that, but it did contextualize their success in some really interesting ways, not the least of which was the racial makeup of South Florida in the 70s, 80s and 90s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9. The House of Steinbrenner&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left:30px;&quot;&gt;New Yorkers like to win. The Yankees win, a lot. This documentary is about winning, but it also humanizes the organization and especially George Steinbrenner. It also features the most crying out of any of the documentaries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10. Run Ricky Run&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left:30px;&quot;&gt;On some level, this was the most interesting documentary for me. This profile of Ricky Williams, one of the NFLs most talented and promising running backs, shows a man battling with himself in so many ways. At one point, one of Williams&#39; family friends says something that really hit home for me and made sense of all of Williams&#39; troubles -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote style=&quot;padding-left:30px;&quot;&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left:30px;&quot;&gt;Ricky&#39;s identity formation was flawed, it became tightly linked to what he was supposed to be, to his achievements. He needed it to be rooted in sweet acceptance, so he could love himself. Ricky longed for that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;11. One Night in Vegas&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left:30px;&quot;&gt;This documentary is filmed as a graphic novel. It explores the relationship that Mike Tyson and Tupac Shakur had around the time of Tupac&#39;s death (the night of a Tyson fight in Vegas). It also features some really great spoken word poetry that hits home the comparisons between Tyson at his prime as a boxer and Tupac at his prime as a rapper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would be pretty awesome to give this treatment to some other topics. For me, political science, social science, economics, international relations, the presidency, fiscal policy and things of that sort come to mind. But really, any worthwhile topic would be interesting to ask 30 people to make hour-long documentaries about. Its not exhaustive by any means, but it would be fun.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Mac OSX Lion review</title>
   <link href="/blog/technology/mac-osx-lion-review/"/>
   <updated>2011-07-20T17:58:16-04:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/technology/mac-osx-lion-review</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://samarthbhaskar.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/lion.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-351 aligncenter&quot; title=&quot;Lion&quot; src=&quot;assets/lion.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;272&quot; height=&quot;304&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I downloaded and installed Mac OSX Lion this morning and have been messing around with it today. I don&#39;t think I can say any more in a review than &lt;a href=&quot;http://arstechnica.com/apple/reviews/2011/07/mac-os-x-10-7.ars&quot;&gt;John Siracusa of Ars Technica said in his 19-page review&lt;/a&gt; but a couple of things that I think are worth noting are listed below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. Its pretty remarkable how much Lion borrows from iOS (Apple&#39;s mobile OS). Instinctually, I would think a mobile OS is inspired by a desktop OS but with the ubiquity of smart phones and tablets, it makes perfect sense that the flow of innovation is now flowing both ways. This is abundantly clear in features like the new &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apple.com/macosx/whats-new/launchpad.html&quot;&gt;Launchpad &lt;/a&gt;which resembles the iOS Springboard, or the central focus on the Mac App Store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. The added &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apple.com/macosx/whats-new/gestures.html&quot;&gt;track-pad gestures &lt;/a&gt;are quite great. Since I project my desktop from Macbook Pro to an LCD screen with external mouse and keyboard, I feel like I&#39;m losing out on some functionality by using a traditional mouse. Some of the new gestures can be replicated with a 2-click external mouse, but many that require multiple fingers on the track-pad are best used either with the Macbook Pro track pad or external &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apple.com/magictrackpad/&quot;&gt;Magic track pad&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. While I like to delude myself that I can multi-task well on the computer, I know there are time where the ability to focus my attention on one task is important. The new&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apple.com/macosx/whats-new/full-screen.html&quot;&gt; full-screen&lt;/a&gt; feature for almost all apps is great for this. There were many work-arounds for this sort of thing before, but with Lion this feature is available on almost all apps, and you hardly lose any functionality while in full screen mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was also happy with the quick (and relatively cheap) download and upgrade through the App store. Unlike some others who had long waits or slow downloads, from start to finish my download and upgrade took around 40 minutes. I would be much more willing to upgrade or download apps and utilities if the process was this seamless. Looking ahead, it might become even less cumbersome with over-the-air updates in iOS 5 and whatever future iterations of Mac OS we can look forward to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>On metaphors</title>
   <link href="/blog/books/commentary%20on%20works/social%20science/on-metaphors/"/>
   <updated>2011-07-15T08:09:55-04:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/books/commentary%20on%20works/social%20science/on-metaphors</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The Chronicle of Higher Education has a &lt;a href=&quot;http://chronicle.com/article/Whats-a-Metaphor-For-/128079/&quot;&gt;review&lt;/a&gt; of James Geary&#39;s &lt;em&gt;I is an other&lt;/em&gt;, a new book on the place of metaphors in language. This quote from Geary was well received -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Metaphor conditions our interpretations of the stock market and, through advertising, it surreptitiously infiltrates our purchasing decisions. In the mouths of politicians, metaphor subtly nudges public opinion; in the minds of businesspeople, it spurs creativity and innovation. In science, metaphor is the preferred nomenclature for new theories and new discoveries; in psychology, it is the natural language of human relationships and emotions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although I wouldn&#39;t go as far as someone like Derrida, I think there is definitely value in the work of someone like George Lakoff who advanced the idea that metaphors are a conceptual (not merely linguistic) construction. His forays into political science, through things like conservative concepts of the paternal state versus progressive concepts of a maternal state, are pretty useful.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>William Faulkner on winning the Nobel Prize</title>
   <link href="/blog/books/commentary%20on%20works/culture%20and%20society/william-falkner-on-winning-the-nobel-prize/"/>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&quot;I believe that man will not merely endure: he will prevail. He is immortal, not because he alone among creatures has an inexhaustible voice, but because he has a soul, a spirit capable of compassion and sacrifice and endurance. The poet&#39;s, the writer&#39;s, duty is to write about these things.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Last Train Home (2009)</title>
   <link href="/blog/culture%20and%20society/economics/international%20relations/movies/last-train-home-2009/"/>
   <updated>2011-07-01T14:34:06-04:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/culture%20and%20society/economics/international%20relations/movies/last-train-home-2009</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1512201/&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-335&quot; title=&quot;lth&quot; src=&quot;assets/lth.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;303&quot; height=&quot;166&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1512201/&quot;&gt;Last Train Home (2009) &lt;/a&gt;is a Chinese documentary dedicated to migrant workers in China. It follows a family working to produce consumer goods for Western consumers that end up destroying the lives of the producers who hardly get paid a dime for their labor. It features heart-wrenching scenes of a father and mother committing themselves to arduous factory work only to see their son and daughter once a year during the Chinese New Year (only reaching them after being herded like cattle on crowded trains traveling between provinces). The entire film captures very well the emotions of the bleak reality of migrant workers&#39; lives. The &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Great-Stagnation-Low-Hanging-Eventually-ebook/dp/B004H0M8QS&quot;&gt;low-hanging fruit&lt;/a&gt;&quot; of China that has catapulted it to global economic success hardly benefits from these successes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the film is wrought with pain and strife, it comes highly recommended as a fantastic piece of work in film-making and also as a worthwhile look into migrant workers lives in China. I can only imagine that the struggles featured in this film are characteristic of struggles of workers around the world.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Education and economic output</title>
   <link href="/blog/books/commentary%20on%20works/economics/politics/education-and-economic-output/"/>
   <updated>2011-07-01T13:45:41-04:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/books/commentary%20on%20works/economics/politics/education-and-economic-output</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.spiked-online.com/index.php/site/reviewofbooks_article/10638/&quot;&gt;Hollowing out of the ivory tower&lt;/a&gt;&quot; Tim Black addresses Prof. Alison Wolf&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.co.uk/Does-Education-Matter-Economic-Business/dp/0140286608&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Does Education Matter? Myths About Education and Economic Growth&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Prof. Wolf&#39;s biggest criticism is that higher education has become far too mechanized and is merely an instrument to drive economic growth. She warns&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;An increase in the quantity of graduates will neither create a dynamic, wealth-producing economy nor will it create the conditions for the emergence of lots of dynamic, wealth-producing individuals. Universities are not what they are currently being cracked up to be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This leads to another problem&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Higher education has become central to the economic wellbeing of nations and individuals’, that it is becoming increasingly difficult to recall what the purpose of institutions of higher education might be. Their autonomy as academic bodies, in which one ought to be free to pursue an interest in a subject area to a higher level, has been effaced by their thoroughgoing instrumentalisation as drivers of economic growth and social mobility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;d say the correlation between education attainment and income potential is pretty well documented (its a pet example for instructors when picking social science data upon which to draw elementary formal models). However, this idea that the unintended consequence of viewing education attainment as an economic activity rather than a humanistic or perhaps political activity is worth note. Prof Wolf has written this book in the context of the UK but I think this warning readily applies to most advanced higher-education contexts, including the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Taking down Michael Lewis</title>
   <link href="/blog/books/commentary%20on%20works/social%20science/taking-down-michael-lewis/"/>
   <updated>2011-06-29T13:34:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/books/commentary%20on%20works/social%20science/taking-down-michael-lewis</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Michael Lewis has amassed quite a reputation on the back of his 2010 book &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Big-Short-Inside-Doomsday-Machine/dp/0393338827/ref=pd_cp_b_1&quot;&gt;The Big Short&lt;/a&gt;. I remember reading the book and listening to coverage on shows like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/355/the-giant-pool-of-money&quot;&gt;This American Life&#39;s The Giant Pool of Money &lt;/a&gt;in 2010 to try and understand the financial crisis. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2010/03/debunking-michael-lewis-subprime-short-hagiography.html&quot;&gt;This piece&lt;/a&gt;, however, has a lot to say about what Lewis missed in his book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lewis’ desire to satisfy his fan base’s craving for good guys led him to miss the most important story of our age: how a small number of operators used a nexus of astonishing leverage and camouflaged risk to bring the world financial system to its knees and miraculously walked away with their winnings. These players are not the ugly ducklings of Lewis’ fairy tale; they are merely ugly. Whether for his own profit or by accident, Lewis has denied the public the truth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can certainly understand the argument that Lewis was writing for a different audience (as perhaps Ezra Klein was in this &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/post/what-inside-job-got-wrong/2011/05/19/AGgGoJgH_blog.html&quot;&gt;piece&lt;/a&gt;, which was also &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2011/06/ezra-klein-should-stick-to-being-wrong-about-health-care.html#Topics&quot;&gt;rebuked&lt;/a&gt;) but I think after a cursory understanding is established, these kinds of nuanced complications are absolutely necessary for better policy building and informed decision making (including personal voting behavior) in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Jose Antonio Vargas in NYT - My Life As an Undocumented Immigrant</title>
   <link href="/blog/commentary%20on%20works/culture%20and%20society/washington%20dc/jose-antonio-vargas-in-nyt-my-life-as-an-undocumented-immigrant/"/>

   <id>/blog/commentary%20on%20works/culture%20and%20society/washington%20dc/jose-antonio-vargas-in-nyt-my-life-as-an-undocumented-immigrant</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/26/magazine/my-life-as-an-undocumented-immigrant.html?_r=1&amp;amp;src=tptw&amp;amp;pagewanted=all&quot;&gt;piece&lt;/a&gt; in the NYT by Pulitzer Prize winning journalist Jose Antonio Vargas is showing up every where today, and for good reason. Its a very moving account of an undocumented immigrant who has done everything he can to try and earn his place in the U.S. I, like everyone else talking about the piece, highly suggest reading it all but these lines at the end were the hardest hitting for me -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the real reason was, after so many years of trying to be a part of the system, of focusing all my energy on my professional life, I learned that no amount of professional success would solve my problem or ease the sense of loss and displacement I felt. I lied to a friend about why I couldn’t take a weekend trip to Mexico. Another time I concocted an excuse for why I couldn’t go on an all-expenses-paid trip to Switzerland. I have been unwilling, for years, to be in a long-term relationship because I never wanted anyone to get too close and ask too many questions. All the while, Lola’s question was stuck in my head: What will happen if people find out?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I certainly don&#39;t have a solution to the immigration concerns and as a naturalized immigrant myself, my views are colored but the idea of &quot;earning&quot; your citizenship seems amazingly loaded with moral evaluations and value judgments to me. Why is economic output or education attainment deemed a viable path to citizenship? Like I said, i don&#39;t know the answer to this or any of the related questions, but I do think it is important to ask these questions.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Still Bill (2009)</title>
   <link href="/blog/commentary%20on%20works/movies/music/still-bill-2009/"/>
   <updated>2011-06-15T18:56:01-04:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/commentary%20on%20works/movies/music/still-bill-2009</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;While reading &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.playboy.com/magazine/justin-timberlake-interview/2&quot;&gt;this Justin Timberlake interview&lt;/a&gt; I ran across a Bill Withers documentary called &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1333117/&quot;&gt;Still Bill&lt;/a&gt;. Here&#39;s what Justin Timberlake had to say about the film, and what it meant to him -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TIMBERLAKE: &lt;/strong&gt;You should watch the documentary &lt;em&gt;Still Bill.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PLAYBOY: &lt;/strong&gt;That’s the Bill Withers documentary, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TIMBERLAKE:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, and I’ve never watched anything else that made me feel someone was speaking not just to me but for me. He puts into words exactly how I feel about music. People asked Bill Withers all the time, “Why did you stop doing music?” Which is what I get asked all the time too. He said, “I don’t know what to say, because I didn’t stop doing music. I just started doing something else.” He also quoted Thoreau: “The mass of men live lives of quiet desperation.” Only Bill added, “I want to know what it feels like for my desperation to get louder.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PLAYBOY: &lt;/strong&gt;What does that mean to you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TIMBERLAKE:&lt;/strong&gt; Well, I relate to that because it means you need inspiration, you need to hear something loud inside yourself before you can create anything. Unfortunately, the business of music is what taints an artist’s desire to make music. I don’t want to paint a picture of being jaded, because I love making music. I honestly love it. But there is a level where making music becomes a total life-sucking commitment. For instance, to do an album and a tour, you have to be absolutely certain that whatever you have to say is from the heart, because you’re going to say it a thousand times—and on nights when you don’t feel like performing. You need to feel inspiration to get to a level where you’re performing like that. But I haven’t felt that level of conviction the past few years. And without that conviction it’s crazy to put yourself out there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After watching the documentary, I couldn&#39;t agree more. The film features Withers imparting short bits of his own philosophy that seems amazingly pragmatic but not void of any of the emotion that sometimes pragmatism lacks. It was heartening to see a man who achieved so much in life seem thankful for it, but never seem like he felt he deserved it or that it was owed to him. Withers struggled as a child with stuttering, came from humble beginnings in a coal-mining town in West Virginia and worked as a factory worker before stepping into fame as a musician - and I think that lent a lot to his ability to make the most of his life instead of expecting the most from his life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At one point he remarks, &quot;&quot;On the way to wonderful, you&#39;ll pass through all right. Stop and take a look around, because that&#39;s where you may be staying.&quot; As I move forward into my own career, I can happily take solace in this advice. I still plan on aiming at &quot;wonderful&quot; but I&#39;m happy to take a look around and &quot;alright&quot; and appreciate it on its own terms. In any case, the film comes highly recommended.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Eric Whitacre interviewed by Intelligent Life</title>
   <link href="/blog/commentary%20on%20works/culture%20and%20society/music/technology/eric-whitacre-interviewed-by-intelligent-life/"/>
   <updated>2011-06-14T10:21:27-04:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/commentary%20on%20works/culture%20and%20society/music/technology/eric-whitacre-interviewed-by-intelligent-life</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Eric Whitacre, one of my favorite composers since high school, has a new &lt;a href=&quot;http://moreintelligentlife.com/blog/luiza-oleszczuk/qa-eric-whitacre&quot;&gt;interview up at Intelligent Life&lt;/a&gt;. I love following his career but I&#39;ve been sort of disappointed that a lot of his composing has been overshadowed by the glitz of his&lt;a href=&quot;http://ericwhitacre.com/the-virtual-choir&quot;&gt; virtual choir forays&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the interview, Whitacre talks about his nuanced relationship with technology. He claims that he still composes on paper, rather than on a computer, but that he enjoys being introduced to a lot of different kinds of music because of the web. I&#39;m glad that he isn&#39;t the type of person to just be completely technotopian (championing technology for any and every use) or completely technophobian (read: Luddite).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This anecdote about Debussy stirred some thoughts for me -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Paris, at the beginning of the 20th century, Debussy went to see a Gamelan orchestra and it completely changed his writing and basically blew his mind. But today I can go through 30 or 40 genres of music in one day, just by browsing the web, so the exposure to different kinds of music and therefore different ideologies is unprecedented. As a composer I know that all sorts of sounds I hear are making their way into my brain and soul, and later sneak into my music.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if the reason that Debussy had his mind blown was because he hadn&#39;t spent all that time being exposed to different kinds of music on the web? What about the possibility that Debussy was so entrenched in one form of composing that he reached a saturation point before he could truly have his mind blown by the Gamelan orchestra? I think claiming (although I don&#39;t think Whitacre is claiming this, but some have) that similar results may happen in a completely new cultural and information milieu is unreasoned.&lt;/p&gt;

The podcast features an interesting conversation between Zakaria and the hosts Adam Davidson and Alex Blumberg. I&#39;ve never really thought Zakaria is a remarkable scholar or thinker but he is certainly one of the more impressive voices in the media (although that doesn&#39;t seem to be a difficult task to accomplish given our abysmal media landscape).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A short excerpt about the future for the U.S. I found interesting. This is something people have been saying for a while but as California&#39;s position worsens considerably and as the U.S. runs up against challenge after challenge, these words move from mere prognostication to reality -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Think of California as a metaphor. California has the most dazzling private sector in the world, really. If you think about Silicon Valley, plus Hollywood, plus all these things that spawn from it. It&#39;s amazing. And yet when the state is collapsing, when the infrastructure is collapsing, when you build more prisons than you do college campuses ... after a while it becomes very difficult to be a viable economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

   <id>/blog/books/commentary%20on%20works/technology/the-epidemic-of-mental-illness</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In the NY Times book review, Marcia Angell &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2011/jun/23/epidemic-mental-illness-why/?pagination=false&quot;&gt;reviews 3 new books&lt;/a&gt; on the topic of mental illness and the existing medical treatments. In one of the books, the author goes so far as to claim&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt; the relatively small difference between drugs and placebos might not be a real drug effect at all. Instead, it might be an enhanced placebo effect, produced by the fact that some patients have broken [the] blind and have come to realize whether they were given drug or placebo. If this is the case, then there is no real antidepressant drug effect at all. Rather than comparing placebo to drug, we have been comparing “regular” placebos to “extra-strength” placebos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think just as with advances in neuroscience based on increasing reliance on fMRI technology (including forays into fields like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.deepdyve.com/lp/psycarticles-reg/the-cognitive-neuroscience-toolkit-for-the-neuroeconomist-dEW5FpGXyY&quot;&gt;neuro-economics&lt;/a&gt; and so on) all of these claims are no better than theoretical conjectures at this point. However, the big difference between neuroscience and treatment for depression/anxiety/mental illness is that these treatments have real and sustained consequences for patients.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Louis CK on why he loves Bill Clinton</title>

   <id>/blog/commentary%20on%20works/culture%20and%20society/politics/tv/louis-ck-on-why-he-loves-bill-clinton</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In this &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.esquire.com/features/man-at-his-best/q-and-a/louis-ck-interview-0611&quot;&gt;interview with Louis CK&lt;/a&gt;, he mentions, among many other gems, why he and Chris Rock love Bill Clinton -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Me and Chris try to study a lot of different kinds of people, not just comedians. We both love Bill Clinton — Clinton is America&#39;s headliner. One of the greatest things I ever saw was him at Coretta Scott King&#39;s funeral. Jimmy Carter, George Bush Senior, Hillary — all these people making speeches, and then Bill Clinton goes on and he says, &quot;Let&#39;s all remember that that is a &lt;em&gt;woman&lt;/em&gt; lying right there.&quot; And he points at her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was audacious. &quot;That is a woman who had her dreams and her pain and her passions,&quot; and I think he said &quot;lust.&quot; He said really personal shit about her and you immediately heard the black people go, &quot;Yes!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He says, &quot;There&#39;s her &lt;em&gt;family&lt;/em&gt; — think about what they&#39;re going through today, and everything that&#39;s happened to them since their daddy got shot. The burden that must have been hers.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Holy shit. I hope to have &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; of that skill as a comic. He just found this short circuit. You try to have this nature the way water does — finds the lowest place and spreads the fuck out. That&#39;s what he did.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is of course not the first time I&#39;ve heard someone say such things about Clinton, but it may be the first time I&#39;ve heard a comedian say them.&lt;/p&gt;

   <updated>2011-05-17T15:07:10-04:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/commentary%20on%20works/culture%20and%20society/politics/cornel-west-vs-potus</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Cornel West has come out recently against President Obama, calling him out on his pro-corporate behavior and overall disappointment as POTUS. In &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.truthdig.com/report/print/the_obama_deception_why_cornel_west_went_ballistic_20110516/&quot;&gt;this interview&lt;/a&gt; with Chris Hedges he has two main grievances with Obama, personal and political/ideological. Basically, West feels slighted by Obama for his inattention during the 2008 campaign and (more importantly) disappointed that Obama hasn&#39;t reigned in the influence of banks, corporations and the like on government over the course of his time in office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not merely a knee jerk reaction, but this just seems petty to me. Melissa Harris-Perry has some thoughts &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thenation.com/blog/160725/cornel-west-v-barack-obama&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; that I think may be important to consider (although this piece is somewhat petty in itself). My initial reaction to West&#39;s words earlier today was &quot;ugh&quot; and I stand by it.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Over the weekend I watched &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1255953/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Incendies&lt;/em&gt; (2010)&lt;/a&gt;, a French-Canadian film based on a play about a pair of siblings who are hurled down a journey down their mother&#39;s past in Lebanon, to answer some very important questions. The film is set up right away with an obvious &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacGuffin&quot;&gt;MacGuffin&lt;/a&gt; regarding an unknown father and brother, and it follows this quest along a path of historical events centered on the Lebanese Civil War. The film is enhanced by a knowledge of the basics of the Lebanese Civil War, but can certainly be understood without.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really enjoyed the film and recommend it highly. It is certainly not for the faint of heart, but the story is masterfully crafted and the film is beautifully put together.

   <title>Highly-skilled immigrants as low hanging fruit</title>
   <link href="/blog/books/commentary%20on%20works/international%20relations/politics/highly-skilled-immigrants-as-low-hanging-fruit/"/>
   <updated>2011-05-12T10:39:47-04:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/books/commentary%20on%20works/international%20relations/politics/highly-skilled-immigrants-as-low-hanging-fruit</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.slate.com/id/2293628/pagenum/all/&quot;&gt;Slate&lt;/a&gt; has a short piece addressing Cowen&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Great-Stagnation-Low-Hanging-Eventually-ebook/dp/B004H0M8QS&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Great Stagnation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, in particular the idea of &quot;low hanging fruit.&quot; The author here argues that highly-skilled immigrants may serve as another source of stimulation for the economy while the US tries to figure out how to move forward into the future. As an immigrant myself, my family and I have lived through the naturalization process that this article describes. I think the introduction of working visas and paths to citizenship for entrepreneurs is definitely very interesting and a worthwhile endeavor, although these critiques hold pretty true as well -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The legislation provides a few new paths to permanent residency for entrepreneurs. For instance, a prospective immigrant could win a temporary visa if she raises at least $100,000 from a qualified investor for a new business. Her visa would become permanent if, within two years, her business created five jobs and raised $500,000 in additional investment, or had sales of $500,000. The bill also encourages entrepreneurs on temporary and education visas to stay, and foreign business owners to move and expand operations here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a good idea, but perhaps still too restrictive. For one, the Startup Visa has inflexible rules about sales, capital investment, and job creation. What if a foreign-born computer scientist created the next Google in her garage, but by the end of two years only had a few thousand dollars in investment and one other worker? Second, the bill does not recognize the importance of failure. Most new businesses don&#39;t make it off the ground. But many entrepreneurs try again, and some succeed the second or third or 20&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; time around. Better to keep those aspirational workers on our shores. Third, and most important, the bill does not actually expand the number of available visas, just 9,940 in the relevant program. It just makes them easier for entrepreneurs to get.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think dis-aggregating the issue of immigration is one of the most difficult tasks in moving this issue forward, especially from a public opinion perspective. Its hard to bring up policy concerns and have fruitful conversations about this topic because its so often mired in debates about illegality, resource draining, racism and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>The reality of reality television</title>
   <link href="/blog/commentary%20on%20works/culture%20and%20society/tv/the-reality-of-reality-television/"/>
   <updated>2011-05-11T09:22:15-04:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/commentary%20on%20works/culture%20and%20society/tv/the-reality-of-reality-television</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;blockquote&gt;One of the biggest differences between today’s reality television and its 1973 antecedent is the genre’s status. Having outgrown PBS, it has inherited the rotten reputation that once attached to the medium itself. In an era of televised precocity—ambitious HBO dramas, cunningly self-aware sitcoms—reality shows still provide a fat target for anyone seeking symptoms or causes of American idiocy; the popularity of unscripted programming has had the unexpected effect of ennobling its scripted counterpart. The same people who brag about having seen every episode of “Friday Night Lights” will brag, too, that they have never laid eyes on “The Real Housewives of Atlanta.” Reality television is the television of television.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[...]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having logged those thousand hours, Pozner can attest that reality shows have a tendency to blur together into a single orgy of joy and disappointment and recrimination. In her view, this is no coincidence: the shows are constructed to reinforce particular social norms, she argues, and she finds examples from across the reality spectrum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From this New Yorker piece on reality TV. Its very interesting to think about the scripts of reality TV shows drawing from a pool populated by social norms. Usually art has a creator behind it, who has a purposeful intent in the way he/she is depicting life or a slice of life. I suppose in some ways if we all can draw from the same or similar pool of social norms, then it makes sense that a depiction of that on TV should be quite popular.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;blockquote&gt;You see, in my view a writer is a writer not because she writes well and easily, because she has amazing talent, because everything she does is golden. In my view a writer is a writer because even when there is no hope, even when nothing you do shows any sign of promise, you keep writing anyway. Wasn&#39;t until that night when I was faced with all those lousy pages that I realized, really realized, what it was exactly that I am.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Wesley Yang has a &lt;a href=&quot;http://nymag.com/news/features/asian-americans-2011-5/&quot;&gt;long-form piece&lt;/a&gt; in the NY Mag that cuts and weaves its away across some pretty important issues of gender, power, social-mobility and self-actualization as they manifest themselves for many Asian-Americans. Originally, I thought this piece was kind of a re-hashing of old issues, but after talking to some people and thinking more about it, I think it addresses some concerns that a lot of people don&#39;t afford themselves the opportunity to address. Although it winds up talking about the over-discussed &lt;a href=&quot;http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704111504576059713528698754.html&quot;&gt;Amy Chua&lt;/a&gt; controvery, I think its worth the read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A short excerpt that I liked, maybe because I feel like I&#39;m in this place in my life now -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Throughout my twenties, I proudly turned away from one institution of American life after another (for instance, a steady job), though they had already long since turned away from me. Academe seemed another kind of death—but then again, I had a transcript marred by as many F’s as A’s. I had come from a culture that was the middle path incarnate. And yet for some people, there can be no middle path, only transcendence or descent into the abyss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was descending into the abyss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

   <title>Bringing causal models into the mainstream</title>

   <id>/blog/commentary%20on%20works/grad%20school/social%20science/bringing-causal-models-into-the-mainstream</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~cook/movabletype/archives/2011/05/bringing_causal.html&quot;&gt;Andrew Gelman&lt;/a&gt; points to &lt;a href=&quot;http://statisticsforum.wordpress.com/2011/05/10/bringing-causal-models-into-the-mainstream/&quot;&gt;John Johnson&lt;/a&gt; who has written a short piece about causal modeling in the mainstream. This blurb seems most important to me -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, that leaves the last point, which may cause some controversy. &quot;Do not try this at home.&quot; Causal analysis does not have a SAS proc or simple R routine (perhaps with the exception of two-stage least squares). This is going to have to come at the end of perhaps hours of data exploration, modeling, testing, rejecting, trying something else, and finally accepting. A causal model is not always going to be easy to write into a statistical analysis plan, and primary investigators may not want something so fluid in the plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although Johnson works primarily in the pharmaceutical industry where the processes of randomization and experiment design are quite rigorous, I think this point is quite important for the social sciences as well. Throughout this year I&#39;ve found that causal analysis is too often the goal of observational studies, when in fact they should perhaps be a lot more careful in making any strong causal inferences from (what is likely to quite flawed) data. I have taken some extra pains to do this in my MA thesis, and I&#39;m happier with it as a result.&lt;/p&gt;

Its a good reminder, for those who need reminding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m not sure about this claim here, seems dubious to me, but that&#39;s just a gut reaction for now -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet maybe the simplest way to save her life would have been contraception. If Somali women had half as many pregnancies (they now average six births), there would be only half as many maternal deaths. But modern contraception doesn’t exist in this part of Somaliland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I always considered this as a very important tertiary benefit of Clinton being in Obama&#39;s cabinet, but I don&#39;t hear about it nearly enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;She accepted the post, in November of 2008, only after President-Elect Obama—in an inspired move over the objections of many on his campaign staff—twisted not just her arm, she informed friends, but her fingers, toes, and every other bone in her body. The president, for his part, is proud of himself for choosing her. He knows that she represents the United States better than anyone but him and is—to the surprise of many Obama veterans—refreshingly low-maintenance. When budget season arrived this year and the departments all faced drastic cuts, Hillary used a Cabinet meeting to offer tips on how to avoid making cuts that would affect vulnerable people—children, the elderly—and look bad politically. (She recalled that Newt Gingrich’s effort to slash the school-lunch program, which put Gingrich on the defensive, was the real turning point in the 1995 budget debate.) Several second-tier Cabinet members thought it one of the most useful White House meetings they had ever attended.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DFW:&lt;/strong&gt; The reason why doing political writing is so hard  right now is probably also the reason why more young (am I included in  the range of this predicate anymore?) fiction writers ought to be doing  it. As of 2003, the rhetoric of the enterprise is fucked. 95 percent of  political commentary, whether spoken or written, is now polluted by the  very politics it’s supposed to be about. Meaning it’s become totally  ideological and reductive: The writer/speaker has certain political  convictions or affiliations, and proceeds to filter all reality and spin  all assertion according to those convictions and loyalties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.believermag.com/issues/200311/?read=interview_wallace&quot;&gt;this interview&lt;/a&gt; in Believer Mag by Dave Eggers of DFW.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Paul Krugman's "How I work"</title>

   <id>/blog/commentary%20on%20works/politics/krugman-how-i-work</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I ran across this essay by Paul Krugman entitled &quot;How I work&quot; in which he chronicles his research philosophy and lays out a quick trajectory of how he got where he is today. It was a really interesting read. If for no other reason, it was interesting to see a public intellectual discuss his personal journey and outline his professional/academic methodology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His rules of research include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Listen to the Gentiles&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. Question the question&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. Dare to be silly&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4. Simplify, simplify&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The section on engagement with the policy-sphere was something I found particularly interesting. This is something I aspire to do. I aim to (successfully, I hope) toe that line between high level academic research and policy consulting. It was good to receive validation from someone who set out on that path early in his career and was able to make strong contributions in both arenas.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Black Swan (2010)</title>
   <link href="/blog/black-swan-2010/"/>
   <updated>2010-12-13T17:42:14-05:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/black-swan-2010</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I got to check out &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0947798/&quot;&gt;Black Swan&lt;/a&gt; last weekend when it opened, and wanted to write something about it for a while but because of finals, I couldn&#39;t get to it until now. One of my friends shared this &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.charlierose.com/view/interview/11324&quot;&gt;Charlie Rose interview&lt;/a&gt; with me earlier today, and it really sparked the same thoughts (and some new ones) I had last week once again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the strongest feelings I walked away with was how much the movie felt like Darren Aronofsky&#39;s other works, and most closely the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1125849/&quot;&gt;The Wrestler (2008)&lt;/a&gt;. Aronofsky explained the resemblances in the Charlie Rose interview (as explorations of high art and low art, of the use of bodies in entertainment), but to me the most profound similarity was what I felt Aronofsky was saying to the audience at the end of each movie. Both The Wrestler and Black Swan end with applause in the background, but with a strong sense of want or disappointment lingering for the viewer (I&#39;ll hold off on saying more on that so as not to spoil the ending for those who have yet to see it).  I took this to be Aronofsky&#39;s way of saying &quot;Are you happy? Do you see what these entertainers have gone through to try and appease your insatiable appetite? Is this what you want?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Charlie Rose interview, Natalie Portman also brought up some really interesting points about the movie that bear heavily on my own current state in personal development. Portman described her transformation in the movie from a &quot;ballet girl&quot; to a &quot;woman,&quot; as one which mirrors her real-life transformation into womanhood. One of the ways the movie portrays this is by Nina (Portman&#39;s character) moving away from trying to please everyone else and finding her own pleasure. This was a fascinating commentary on adulthood to me. I think too often personal focus is seen as childish, selfish or unbecoming of a well-functioning adult. In fact, I think the idea of finding your own pleasure is a great way to conceptualize ownership of yourself and your own happiness in adulthood, something I am working on for myself recently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Black Swan is a fantastic artifact of film-making. It is meta-cognitive, highly subjective, beautifully scored and a much needed film in what seems like a drought in high quality films recently.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Ain&#39;t It Cool News announced &lt;a href=&quot;http://http://www.aintitcool.com/node/47547&quot;&gt;a competition&lt;/a&gt; today for 10 spots to see a special screening of Darren Aronofsky&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0947798/&quot;&gt;Black Swan&lt;/a&gt; in Chicago on Monday. One of the stipulations of the competition was to include a short blurb on what your favorite movie about madness is and why. Below is what I sent in regarding The Conversation, a 1974 film starring Gene Hackman and directed by Francis Ford Coppola.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coppola&#39;s directing, the haunting score and Hackman&#39;s lifetime performance all really made for a terrific film. Hackman&#39;s character is a microcosm for 20th century America for me, his attention is so focused on being the best, that he doesn&#39;t realize how much he&#39;s screwing up in other facets of his life. I also think there is a lot going on in the character that speaks to every-day madness. The kind of madness that builds on itself and never goes over the edge to truly raise suspicion, but for the person experiencing it, it can almost ruin daily life. That&#39;s the kind of madness the majority of people deal with, the kind of that doesn&#39;t turn violent but still eats away at the hope of a &quot;normal&quot; life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hope I get to see the screening on Monday!&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A friend of mine mentioned this speech to me the other day. I had never heard of it before, especially with Obama&#39;s 2004 DNC address being the most popular speaking event connected with the DNC in my recently developed political conscience. I finally got around to reading the speech and I had to share it. My friend described it as a &quot;seminal piece of rhetoric in liberal political ideology&quot; and I couldn&#39;t have put it better myself. I would have picked out parts that I liked best, but I am more inclined to promote it in its entirety.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Are political orientations genetically transmitted?</title>
   <link href="/blog/commentary%20on%20works/politics/are-political-orientations-genetically-transmitted/"/>
   <updated>2010-11-09T13:03:08-05:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/commentary%20on%20works/politics/are-political-orientations-genetically-transmitted</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;blockquote&gt;Individual genes for behaviors do not exist and no one denies that humans have the capacity to act against genetic predispositions. But predictably dissimilar correlations of social and political attitudes among people with greater and lesser shared genotypes suggest that behaviors are often shaped by forces of which the actors themselves are not consciously aware, a point that is made with some force by Bargh and Chartrand (1999), Marcus (2002), Marcus, Neuman, and MacKuen (2000), McDermott (2004), and Wegner (2002). It is not biological determinism to posit the existence of complex collections of genes that increase the probability that certain people will display heightened or deadened response patterns to given environmental cues. And it is not antibehavioralism to suggest that true explanations of the source of political attitudes and behaviors will be found when we combine our currently detailed understanding of environmental forces with a recognition that genetic variables subtly but importantly condition human responses to environmental stimuli.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a 2005 study - Alford, J., et al. 2005. “Are political orientations genetically transmitted?” American Political Science Review.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Certainly a very emotional and political topic in itself, but the study includes some convincing evidence for the strong correlations between genetic similarity and development of political attitudes. The quoted paragraph probably strikes closest to my own conceptualization of what genetic determinism and social construction mean in observable behavior and attitudes.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;As long as I have studied the Middle East (which is coming up on 5 years now) Samuel Huntington&#39;s legacy has been inescapable. I have, on so many occasions, engaged in arguments (personal, professional and academic) that are centered around his basic premise of a clash of civilizations between what he calls the West and the Islamic civilization. I can&#39;t even remember how many papers I have written or people I have tried to confront about the shortcomings of this &quot;seminal&quot; work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, Lisa Wedeen puts my thoughts in a pithy and succinct manner -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;This understanding of culture as a specific group’s primordial values or traits is untenable empirically. It ignores the historical conditions and relevant power relationships that give rise to political phenomena such as “democratization,” ethnic conflicts, and contemporary radical Islamicist movements. The group traits version of culture, moreover, rides roughshod over the diversity of views and the experiences of contention within the group or groups under study. In the case of Huntington’s depiction of the Middle East, for ex- ample, such claims of sedimented essences have led scholars of culture to pass over such now obviously urgent matters as the contemporary nature of Islamicist movements, the causes of their recent emergence, and the ways in which communities of argument exist over what makes a Muslim a Muslim, what Islam means, and what, if any, its political role should be. Treating culture as a set of traits that purportedly distinguish one group from another also neglects the terrains of solidarity and fluidity that exist among groups, the ways in which political communities of various sorts have depended on the cross-fertilization of ideas and practices. In short, by ignoring historical processes and specific relations of political power, the treatment of culture in political science has downplayed the heterogeneous ways in which people experience the social order within and among groups, while exaggerating the commonality, constancy, and permanence of intragroup beliefs and values.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

   <title>Mortality Salience and Ideology</title>
   <link href="/blog/commentary%20on%20works/grad%20school/politics/mortality-salience-and-ideology/"/>
   <updated>2010-10-13T12:55:49-04:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/commentary%20on%20works/grad%20school/politics/mortality-salience-and-ideology</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve been reading a lot about ideology for a class recently and there have been a few insights that I&#39;ve found to be pretty beneficial, beyond their use for academic purposes. One of the most interesting findings in the studies I&#39;ve been reading is the concept of mortality salience (making subjects aware of the end of their own lives). Although there are a host of factors that contribute to the development of ideology (societal construction, heredity, childhood development, education, cognitive dispositions, &amp;amp;c), mortality salience was one that I had never really considered on its own merit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;MORTALITY SALIENCE AND EXPRESSED POLITICAL ATTITUDES&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;For example, mortality salience appears to produce greater patriotism and hostility toward critics of one’s nation, a stronger endorsement of the unique validity of one’s own religion, stronger support for traditional gender norms, greater attention to established norms of proce- dural fairness, increased levels of stereotyping, and a generally stronger preference for aggres- sive responses to individuals and groups who are perceived as threatening to the cultural world- view&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MORTALITY SALIENCE, AUTHORITARIANISM, AND SELECTIVE EXPOSURE TO POLITICAL INFORMATION&lt;br /&gt;
An experiment by Lavine et al. (2005) revealed that a mortality salience manipulation led high (but not low) authoritarians to se- lectively expose themselves to information in a manner that was consistent with their position on capital punishment. This find- ing suggests that not everyone responds to threatening stimuli in the same manner (see also Davis &amp;amp; Silver 2004, Stenner 2005). It is important to point out, however, that low authoritarians did not show greater open-mindedness (or a decrease in selective ex- posure) following mortality salience priming (Lavine et al. 2005, p. 232). Lavine et al. (2005) concluded their article by emphasiz- ing elective affinities, that is, “interactions between dispositional motivational needs and cognitive styles on one hand, and ex- igencies of the social and political environment on the other” (p. 240). Specifically, they suggested that those who tune into “the now ubiquitous format of one-sided (generally right-wing) talk radio (e.g., Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity, Michael Savage, Bill O’Reilly)” are motivated not merely by chronic anger and resentment but that “viewers’ preferences for one-sided vs ‘fair and balanced’ formats are at least partly a function of perceived environmental threat” (p. 240).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Certainly an interesting phenomena when applied in combination with demographics of aging voters, or in combination with religious groups.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Foucault vs. Chomsky</title>
   <link href="/blog/commentary%20on%20works/culture%20and%20society/talks/foucault-vs-chomsky/"/>
   <updated>2010-10-05T17:51:42-04:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/commentary%20on%20works/culture%20and%20society/talks/foucault-vs-chomsky</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;There&#39;s a short (13 minute) &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x32axv_chomsky-vs-foucault-1971&quot;&gt;video from 1971&lt;/a&gt; of  a discussion between Noam Chomsky and Michel Foucault that I think gets at so much of what I&#39;ve delved into (academically and personally) for the last few years of my life. In fact, I think I&#39;ve been thinking about this for much longer, I just wasn&#39;t able to articulate it too well until a few years ago. The discussion, &lt;a href=&quot;http://books.google.com/books?id=L4AQAQAAIAAJ&amp;amp;q=foucault+versus+chomsky&amp;amp;dq=foucault+versus+chomsky&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;ei=q7erTJ_5NYu2ngfy09XJBg&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;oi=book_result&amp;amp;ct=result&amp;amp;resnum=1&amp;amp;ved=0CCUQ6AEwAA&quot;&gt;and the longer book,&lt;/a&gt; gets at some of the most profound yet basic arguments in social science, politics, religion, philosophy and really any endeavor in human development. The most pedestrian conceptualization of this argument is the age-old &quot;nature vs. nurture&quot; debate. In a crude sense, Chomsky falls more on the nature side of the debate and Foucault favors nurture in the fight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Essentially, Chomsky argues that human nature seeks and needs creative outlet and that is something that we must strongly consider when establishing our social structures. Foucault responds by questioning Chomsky&#39;s understanding of human nature, claiming that we will never be able to truly understand human nature because we are mired in our own cultural production (informed by the politics, knowledge, philosophy, religion, &amp;amp;c. of the time) of &quot;human-nature&quot; as a concept.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a social scientist, and someone who has written works using Foucaultian lenses in the past, I suppose it comes as no surprise that I side with Foucault more often than not. But what is most interesting to me is that I find myself coming back, again and again to Chomsky. Maybe its because he&#39;s an elegant, unassuming yet capturing speaker and writer. Maybe its because he is the model of a public intellectual, something that I hope one day to be myself. Maybe its because he has done so much terrific work in other (related) fields like linguistics and media studies. Or maybe because his quantitative and technical skills pull at the parts of my brain that easily get convinced of things when explained using the language of mathematics (not because I understand it better, but because I&#39;ve mostly been socialized to think that math is not an argument, its a fact). Whatever the reason, Chomsky has always caught my attention because I think there is certain truth in what he says. His canonical contributions to the study of language acquisition and language development have yet to be thoroughly disproved. And maybe there truly is a human nature that can be understood, and coupled with our fight to uncover power structures in society (as Foucault promotes), we can do a better job of developing social structures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&#39;t believe I will ever get to a place where I can confidently say I side with either nature or nurture in the debate (mostly because I don&#39;t think its ever either/or) but the inquiry into these fields and the analysis of any work I commit to through the lens of this debate seems to be a never-ending prospect.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Social Network (2010) and Catfish (2010)</title>
   <link href="/blog/commentary%20on%20works/culture%20and%20society/movies/social-network-2010-and-catfish-2010/"/>
   <updated>2010-10-04T09:39:29-04:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/commentary%20on%20works/culture%20and%20society/movies/social-network-2010-and-catfish-2010</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Over the weekend, I saw Social Network and Catfish (back to back, in fact). It has been a while since I have been impressed with theatrical releases, so this weekend was a great re-introduction into worthwhile contemporary films.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1584016/&quot;&gt;Catfish&lt;/a&gt; is a documentary about an artist based in New York and his interactions with a family in rural Michigan. If I say any more about the film, I will invariably ruin it. I was fortunate enough to go see it without any idea what it was about (based purely on recommendations from my close friends) and ended up enjoying it a lot. Some things that are important to keep in mind are the fact that it is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.austin360.com/movies/catfish-makers-say-their-film-really-is-a-922498.html&quot;&gt;100% real&lt;/a&gt; and that there will be moments in the movie where you think you&#39;ve gleaned the moral already, but you really &lt;a href=&quot;http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20100922/REVIEWS/100929991&quot;&gt;have to wait until the end &lt;/a&gt;to get everything it has to offer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Social Network was a terrific adventure in film-making. It had me hooked from the first dialog scene, and kept me intently engaged the entire time. I thought Aaron Sorkin did a wonderful job adapting the screenplay from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Accidental-Billionaires-Founding-Facebook-Betrayal/dp/0307740986&quot;&gt;Ben Mezrich book&lt;/a&gt;, the editing and packaging of the film was terrific and David Fincher excelled in his role as a director (one of my friends whom I saw the movie with was bent on arguing that it was his best film yet).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With reference to the subject matter of Social Network, I thought the film-makers did what they had to do, which was to take a pretty complex set of events, and create a viable story out of it, to tell the audience. All the vitriol and backlash about inaccuracies and poor portrayals of &lt;a href=&quot;http://gawker.com/5643915/mark-zuckerberg-describes-the-dirty-tricks-that-led-to-the-facebook-movie&quot;&gt;Zuckerberg may be well-founded&lt;/a&gt;, but that is not the purpose of a film, as a piece of art. One argument that I did find especially beneficial to read was &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tnr.com/article/books-and-arts/78081/sorkin-zuckerberg-the-social-network&quot;&gt;Larry Lessig&#39;s reaction in The National Review&lt;/a&gt;. He argues, in essence, that the film missed an opportunity to make some really important commentary on the nature of an enterprise like Facebook being so different from other successful enterprises in the past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all, it was a great movie weekend, and both of the aforementioned films come highly recommended from me.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Unipolarity and Multipolarity in the International System</title>
   <link href="/blog/unipolarity-and-multipolarity-in-the-international-system/"/>
   <updated>2010-09-29T20:22:44-04:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/unipolarity-and-multipolarity-in-the-international-system</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I spent part of today reading through two important pieces (some would say canonical pieces in International Relations theory) on the stability of an international system characterized by multipolarity or unipolarity. A great debate in international relations is centered on the argument of whether we currently inhabit a unipolar or multi-polar system, obviously with the United States as the focus of the unipolar world (if that is what exists). My purpose here is not to discuss whether we live in  multi-polar or unipolar system (incidentally, I&#39;m of the mindset that we live in a multi-polar world), I am interested in taking up the notion of stability. Stability is defined by a maintenance of the status quo, without adding or subtracting the core number of great powers in the international system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pieces, full citations below, construct basic syllogisms that argue on either side. &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth_Waltz&quot;&gt;Kenneth Waltz &lt;/a&gt;argues, in essence, that a bipolar world is in fact the most stable and durable for peace in the international system. His major contribution to this syllogism is the idea that, in a multi-polar world there are more opportunities for miscalculations between the many alliances and groupings that form, leading to more instability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://sitemaker.umich.edu/jdsinger/home&quot;&gt;Singer&lt;/a&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Deutsch&quot;&gt;Deutsch&lt;/a&gt; argue that a multi-polar system is in fact more stable because the major powers have more incentive and opportunity for cooperation and are more likely to have their attention diffused from just focusing on one polar antagonist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although Waltz&#39;s logic is much stronger and presents a difficult obstacle to overcome in trying to break it down, I would have to side with Singer &amp;amp; Deutsch because I do see multi-polar systems, with their increased opportunities for cooperation and interaction to be far more stable and conducive to peaceful interaction than bipolar systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, all of these calculations and theories are complicated ten-fold in reality with the question of terrorism, non-state actors, rogue states and non-military inputs. None the less, I think it&#39;s a worthwhile analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration:underline;&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;– Waltz, Theory of International Politics, ch. 8. (R)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;– Karl  Deutsch and J. David Singer, &quot;Multipolar Systems and International  Stability,&quot; World Politics, Vol. 16, No. 3 (Apr. 1964), pp. 390-406. (R)&lt;/p&gt;

   <id>/blog/commentary%20on%20works/international%20relations/middle%20east/the-post-american-world-by-fareed-zakaria</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I just finished&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Post-American-World-Fareed-Zakaria/dp/039306235X&quot;&gt; The Post-American World by Fareed Zakaria&lt;/a&gt;. It was a quick read since it mostly feels like a long-form journalistic essay, more than a tough piece of non-fiction. I didn&#39;t particularly find anything about this book to be earth-shattering or controversial, but it was a fair description of the ways in which the global system is undergoing important changes, with the U.S. still at the center.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a nutshell, Zakaria argues that the U.S. is still enjoying a hegemonic unipolar status in the world and certain economic, military and social blunders notwithstanding, America is not being challenged for its primacy in any major way. He spends a good chunk of the book praising China and India for their successes and describing all the ways in which their growth and progress is shaping the international system. He laments on the excess in politics, technology and economics that has led to some of the ills in the world today. He argues about security in a unipolar world and the existence of the major power outside the realm of the system of international initiatives (something I plan on taking up on this blog later this week).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the more interesting thoughts I took from the book was a footnote near the end about Zakaria&#39;s position on Iraq and the invasion of 2003. Here it is, replicated below -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It is not a subject for this book, but I was in favor of the effort to oust Saddam Hussein, though I argued from the start for a much larger force and an internationally sanctioned intervention and occupation. My reasoning was mostly related to the fact that Western policy toward Iraq had collapsed-sanctions were leaking, countless civilians were dying because of the embargo, Al Qaeda was enraged by our base in Saudi Arabia, from which we operated the No Fly Zone-and I believed that a more modern and moderate Iraq in the middle of the Arab world would help break the dysfunctional political dynamics of the Arab world. I opposed, from the first few weeks, Washington&#39;s occupation policies. In retrospect, I underestimated not merely the administration&#39;s arrogance and incompetence but also the inherent difficulty of the task. I continue to believe that a modern, moderate Iraq would make an important difference in the politics of the Middle East, I hope that Iraq will, in the long run, evolve into such a place, but the costs have been ruinously high-for Americans, for America&#39;s reputation, but especially for Iraqis. And foreign policy is a matter of costs and benefits, not theology.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought this passage was especially interesting because Zakaria writes honestly about his support for the deposing of Hussein and the evolution in his thought processes, leading him to where he is today. Most left-of-center thinkers would be quick to dismiss ever having supported intervention efforts, based primarily on the folly that the situation has turned into today. Zakaria&#39;s honesty here is commendable.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>The work of a face, hands and feet on the mind</title>

   <id>/blog/commentary%20on%20works/culture%20and%20society/music/the-work-of-a-face-hands-and-feet-on-the-mind</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In a crowded, dark theater in Downtown Chicago, after a long day of work is not where you expect to find yourself immersed in thought about human connection but that is exactly where I happened to find myself on Wednesday evening. Performing as part of the Chicago World Music Festival, &lt;a href=&quot;http://anjalchande.com/&quot;&gt;Anjal Chande&lt;/a&gt; presented an hour-long performance, comprised of four pieces that blended her mastery of the South-Asian classical dance form Bharatnatyam and her contemporary artistic sensibilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although a dancer by training, Anjal showcased her art through a variety of media. Her spoken word, set to music composed by famed Sitarist Gaurav Mazumdar, Hindustani classical singer Gaurav Venkteswar and collegiate a cappella group Chai-Town (composed and directed by Arjun Venkataswamy) all provided backdrops to Anjal’s dance that pulled the audience into the performance. Anjal brought the audience in closer with her use of her face, hands and feet. The emotive expressions on her face, the meaningful use of her hands and the rhythmic cadence of her feet all worked together to accent the frame of a dancer who commanded not only the stage she performed on but the attention and emotions of her audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anjal explored ideas of thought, creativity, darkness, happiness and human connection with her original pieces. Tapping into the urban lifestyle and its ephemeral nature, Anjal developed one of her pieces around distractions in the mind and the inevitable frustrations that grow out of constant yet shallow contact. In “Darkness,” Anjal proposed that happiness actually lives in darkness and that our imagination is not something to be feared, but something to be coveted. In her final piece, Anjal released her larger-than-life-self onto the stage, darting to and fro while having a delightful conversation with the music she danced to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout her performance, I found myself fixated on Anjal’s artistic thoughts. She created an entire habitat for me, and the audience, to explore ideas that she brought forth. Without any realization that I was doing it, I found myself meandering through my own conceptualizations of happiness, imagination, darkness, distraction and expression. In this, Anjal accomplished something that artists hope to accomplish with every expression. She presented her art with confidence and her real self shined on stage. Anjal embodied, almost literally, her convictions and painted them in an aesthetic that was irresistible for the audience. The entire performance was memorable not because it was foreign or her specific interpretation on human connection, but because it was personal and familiar and reminded me of my own convictions.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Higher literacy thanks to Bollywood</title>
   <link href="/blog/commentary%20on%20works/international%20relations/media%20studies/technology/higher-literacy-thanks-to-bollywood/"/>
   <updated>2010-09-22T14:01:18-04:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/commentary%20on%20works/international%20relations/media%20studies/technology/higher-literacy-thanks-to-bollywood</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The Boston Globe has a new &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/ideas/articles/2010/09/19/watch_and_learn/?page=1&quot;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; up today about some research about how music videos are leading to booming literacy rates in rural India -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Same-language subtitling extricates literacy from the tangles of school  infrastructure and teacher availability. And since television, more than  any other medium, has the power to reach out to billions across the  developing world, it holds unique promise for hard-to-access groups like  rural women, who are discouraged from venturing outside their villages  once they hit puberty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Essentially, the broadcasting of music videos with same-language subtitles has led to a noticeable increase in literacy and functional literacy rates in rural villages in parts of India. By extension, it&#39;s common to notice that progress in societies is often part and parcel with literacy rates, and especially literacy rates among women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Extending this observation further, I think it is important to consider the social value systems that are also being transmitted, along with reading skills, through these music videos. Media theorists, one after another, have brought attention to the idea that the medium through which something is communicated (or in this case taught) carries with it important values, limitations, assumptions and consequences. Educating rural citizens of India through Bollywood music videos could very well lead to a clash in value systems that are characteristic of rural Indian societies versus those found more often in Bollywood films. Although I think these are valid concerns, it goes without saying that higher literacy is a social good that is beneficial, almost without caveat.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Math Camp</title>
   <link href="/blog/general/grad%20school/math-camp/"/>
   <updated>2010-09-21T20:55:56-04:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/general/grad%20school/math-camp</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The last 9 days of my life have been focused around an intensive quantitative survey called Math Camp. It was offered as a voluntary pre-term course to all students entering the social sciences graduate fields to either strengthen existing quantitative skills or be introduced to new quantitative concepts that the department encourages the students to have a better mastery over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the 9 days we studied complex sets, numbers and functions, single-variable integral and differential calculus, matrix algebra, multi-variable calculus and probability &amp;amp; statistics. Of the different quantitative fields, I have the strongest background in statistics, which was strengthened further this summer at my internship at a polling firm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was most surprised at how much retention and comprehension power I had over such complex topics just over the span of 9 days. The course was filled with nearly 6 months worth of instructional material, condensed into 9 days. What I really took away from it was the idea of setting a higher standard of instruction and assuming far more capacity to excel from students than has been the norm in my academic career thus far. I have found too much time wasted and too many goals or skills confounded by the idea that students are not smart enough to grasp concepts, students need to be spoon-fed or some perverse form of lack of confidence. I found great merit in the confidence the instructor had in his pacing and abilities as an instructor and in us as the students. I do not claim (at all) to be have mastery of the concepts I was introduced to, but I am sufficiently impressed by the ways in which this model of instruction succeeded.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>On hyper-links</title>
   <link href="/blog/commentary%20on%20works/media%20studies/technology/on-hyper-links/"/>
   <updated>2010-09-20T20:24:57-04:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/commentary%20on%20works/media%20studies/technology/on-hyper-links</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I’ve been re-reading my way through some of the books on my bookshelf, and I picked up &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Internet-Thinking-Action-Hurbert-Dreyfus/dp/0415228077&quot;&gt;On the Internet by Hubert L. Dreyfus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; the other day. I think it was a required reading for a class at some point but it has been an interesting re-read. One of the first topics Dreyfus takes on is the practice of hyper-linking on the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theshallowsbook.com/nicholascarr/The_Shallows.html&quot;&gt;Nicholas Carr took to critiquing this practice&lt;/a&gt; not too long ago, claiming that hyper-links in articles caused more distractions than they provided substantive or important content (something I’m trying to work on in my own writing). Dreyfus considers hyper-linking practice on web pages and blogs to be similarly disorienting and distracting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dreyfus laments on the disjointed nature of hyper-links and an abundance of information that is available on the Internet without any measure of relevance and importance to the reader. He posits that the way to create true meaning out of hyper-links online is to somehow embody them, by connecting them to embodied experience. He is of the opinion that because the Internet exists completely outside the body, it can never carry the same relevance, risk and importance as embodied knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found these assertions to be particularly curious given the reason why hyper-linking was first utilized during the nascent stages of the Internet. Tim Berners-Lee, one of the proposed inventors of the Internet as we know it today, developed and popularized the hyper-linking system to mimic the way he noticed people made memories, which was through building relationships between new pieces of information and information already situated in the psyche.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So although the argument Dreyfus makes stands, I find it peculiar when weighed against the intentions of hyper-linking, as it was first created. I suppose hardly anything ever pans out as it was first intended, but there is certainly some merit to the intention of hyper-links and certainly some doubt as to why in practice they have become so disjointed and distracting.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Pessimism (but not what you're thinking)</title>
   <link href="/blog/commentary%20on%20works/culture%20and%20society/pessimism-but-not-what-youre-thinking/"/>
   <updated>2010-09-18T08:49:21-04:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/commentary%20on%20works/culture%20and%20society/pessimism-but-not-what-youre-thinking</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;While perusing my subscriptions on Google Reader yesterday (which is something I do entirely way too much during my waking hours), I ran across &lt;a href=&quot;http://modeledbehavior.com/2010/09/17/great-minds-and-all-that/&quot;&gt;this blog post&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;strong&gt;Modeled Behavior&lt;/strong&gt; about a new book entitled &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Uses-Pessimism-Danger-False-Hope/dp/0199747539/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;qid=1284722052&amp;amp;sr=8-1/marginalrevol-20&quot;&gt;&quot;The Uses of Pessimism: And the Danger of False Hope.&quot;&lt;/a&gt; In it Karl Smith quickly points to and adds his thoughts on pessimism and aiming for rational progress. (Tyler Cowen also &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2010/09/the-uses-of-pessimism.html&quot;&gt;pointed to the same book&lt;/a&gt; over at &lt;strong&gt;MR&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While reading the post, I was reminded of a quote from Albert Camus - &quot;Man is the only creature that refuses to be what he is.&quot; Camus was alluding to the idea that by recognizing who we are (including our many limitations) we can successfully be something more, something better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s is a worthwhile proposition, in my opinion. I come from a mentality of shying away from pessimism, from turning a deaf ear and a blind eye to it. I have long considered pessimists to be nihilist, defeatist in their approach and to have a misappropriated lack of vision. However, in allowing myself to review my own biases, I think it is important to consider the utility of pessimism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In reference to the book and the commentary by Smith and Cowen, I find great merit in using pessimism to revise institutions, actions, and traditions. These reviews must be grounded in reality, which author Roger Scruton believes eludes optimists through their denial of the confounded and manipulated realities of humanity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a believer in the progress of our human kind being almost completely based on the random filtering of an unbelievable amount of inputs (speaking evolutionarily), I think it falls in line for me to believe in the merits of pessimism since not all but only a few selected inputs brought us where we are today, and not all but only a few selected inputs will move us forward.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>New Yorker's 20 writers under 40</title>
   <link href="/blog/commentary%20on%20works/culture%20and%20society/new-yorkers-20-writers-under-40/"/>
   <updated>2010-09-16T20:28:08-04:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/commentary%20on%20works/culture%20and%20society/new-yorkers-20-writers-under-40</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The New Yorker has a &lt;a title=&quot;piece&quot; href=&quot;http://www.newyorker.com/fiction/20-under-40/writers-q-and-a&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;piece&lt;/a&gt; online about 20 writers under 40 in which they ask all the writers the same set of questions and also link to some great pieces that these writers have contributed to the magazine in the recent past. One of the most interesting questions in the Q-and-A is &quot;did you ever consider not becoming a writer?&quot; The answers are somewhat varied, but almost without fail amount to some version of &quot;Yes. Duh.&quot; Here are a couple of my favorites&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.newyorker.com/fiction/features/2010/06/14/100614fi_fiction_20under40_qa_jonathan-safran-foer&quot;&gt;Jonathan Safran Foer &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Did  I ever. Do I ever. For a long time, I thought I would like to be a  doctor. Such a good profession. So explicitly good. Never a waste of  time. No obstetrician goes home at the end of a long day and says, “I  delivered four babies. What’s the point?”&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.newyorker.com/fiction/features/2010/06/14/100614fi_fiction_20under40_qa_david-bezmozgis&quot;&gt;David Bezmozgiz&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Since  I easily imagined that I’d never get published, I considered doing  other things. As a fallback plan, I went to film school and trained as a  film director. This was my attempt at pragmatism. I have also taught.  When things are going badly, I still consider doing  other—legitimate—things. Considering doing other—legitimate—things  sometimes feels like a second career.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div&gt;I think what I find most interesting about asking successful people about their own trajectory towards their success is how it humanizes their success. To think of someone like Jonathan Safran Foer still considering the merits of his work is really awe-inspiring and brings a level of ease to my own questioning of life-decisions, work, school, and so on.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;In relation to a profession like writing, its even more interesting to hear these successful writers, still questioning their own place in their industry. I don&#39;t think a similar question would be answered in similar ways in more socially-sanctioned professions. It is also really interesting to see the difference, (made much more apparent for me as I&#39;ve approached, transitioned into and traversed the age around when most people make their first step onto a career path) between occupations that are held in high regard or are fixated upon by the public and the kinds of decisions that are considered economically/personally/professionally viable and beneficial. The two do not meet very often, in my experience. So, although writers are often seen as important members of society, to pursue writing as a profession is hardly met with the same backing.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;In any case, you can check out the stories and Q-and-A in the piece yourself.&lt;/div&gt;

Take a look around the blog, there are some really great entries and its based in Chicago, which is reason enough to love anything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Happy birthday, President Obama.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I woke up this morning,  birthdays weren’t on my mind. On my mind was the wonderful dinner I had  with an old friend last night that left a sweet taste of memories from  college and excitement for the future. On my mind was the fact that  these are the last few weeks of my summer internship in Washington D.C.  before I head back to Chicago for graduate school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But thinking about birthdays, I can say, I’ve had some good ones in my life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2010:&lt;/strong&gt; Spent  with new friends in Beirut, Lebanon while traveling in the Middle East  as a student. Saw the sun rise over the Mediterranean and ate some of  the best kanaffeh imaginable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2009:&lt;/strong&gt; I got a  speeding ticket while driving to Columbia, Missouri to perform with my  best friends as part of a college a cappella group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2008:&lt;/strong&gt; a huge surprise party organized by my mom in my house, featuring my closest friends from college and high school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2000:&lt;/strong&gt; I had chickenpox and was cooped up in the house so my Dad snuck me out  while my mom set up a cake and some gifts (including more Calamine  lotion for the itching).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1997:&lt;/strong&gt; a pizza party at  Nirulas in New Delhi. (For those unfamiliar with late-1990’s New Delhi,  India, this place was the hot spot in town.) I felt very special as a  nine-year-old, with the entire top floor for my friends and family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1989:&lt;/strong&gt; I can’t say I remember this birthday, as it was my first, but I have  been told some great stories about my mom cooking for 200 people who  partied on a rooftop and how my dad provided liquor for everyone even  though we lived in a dry-state in India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Birthdays are tricky,  but I have learned that they’re akin to a lot of lived experience. You  have to manage expectations and also be able to draw meaning in ways  that work for you. Tracing back my birthday means more to me than just  the March 14th’s throughout the years. They’re a testament to the person  I was then, to the important people in my life which all has ultimately  helped me become who I am today.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Why I loved Inception (spoilers within)</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“&lt;/strong&gt;I think when Nolan left the labyrinth, he threw away the map.” – &lt;a href=&quot;http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20100714/REVIEWS/100719997&quot;&gt;Roger Ebert&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;em&gt;Inception&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christopher Nolan’s latest &lt;em&gt;Inception&lt;/em&gt; was released on Friday, July 16. I have been a fan of his work for a while and had been looking forward to this film as the summer hit. I hope by the time I finish this post, I will make it abundantly clear that this film did not disappoint in living up to my high expectations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were many things that impressed me about this film but I have chosen to mention just a few below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exploration of dreams and the subconscious: Christopher Nolan’s commitment to exploring this aspect of people’s subjective experience was immensely impressive. It is rumored that Nolan spent 10 years writing this script, which means he spent at least a good portion of that time analyzing his own dreaming experience. The way he captured such a surreal entity but grounded it in realism was noteworthy in itself. Nolan’s previous works, including &lt;em&gt;Batman Begins &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;The Dark Knight&lt;/em&gt; are also impressive for their ability to explore out-of-this-world concepts while still remaining grounded in realism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.slate.com/id/2260582/pagenum/all/&quot;&gt;Dana Stevens of Slate Magazine&lt;/a&gt; did not feel the same way, saying that “though Nolan is a prodigious architect of detailed dream worlds, he&#39;s too controlled and controlling a filmmaker to give himself over fully to the chaotic logic of dreams.” I would disagree with this estimation of Nolan’s interpretation on dreaming because this is what separates him from Kubric. If I wanted a disjointed, fantasy like interpretation of dreaming, I’d go re-watch &lt;em&gt;Eyes Wide Shut&lt;/em&gt;. (Nolan, while separating himself from Kubric, still &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.indiewire.com/thompsononhollywood/2010/07/05/inception_is_a_kubrickian_masterpiece_with_heart/&quot;&gt;paid homage to the director&lt;/a&gt;, which is admirable in itself)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People’s subjective construction of reality: although this is a concept that may seem absolutely basic and remedial to some, I think it bears pointing out. Nolan was adamant in creating a framework that emphasized the difference in the conscious and subconscious minds of different individuals. In the film, one of the major plot themes is the fact that Cobb’s (Leonardo DiCaprio) reality is heavily affected by his memories and troubled past with his wife (that Ariadne, whose namesake is the Greek goddess who helped Theseus escape from the Minotaur&#39;s labyrinth, helps him work through). This concept can be readily applied to our realities as individuals who inhabit an aggregated world. I think its vital to never forget that people’s realities are constructed based on their own subjective experiences, and that even a communal reality is constructed socially.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Totem concept: to separate the dream-state from consciousness, Nolan developed the concept of a Totem, an object that only the dreamer is familiar with and that can be used to verify the end of a dream and the beginning of reality. I thought this was a clever device used by Nolan that has some grounding in recent neuro-scientific research. Known within psychology as &lt;a href=&quot;http://scienceblogs.com/neurophilosophy/2010/06/touch_influences_social_judgements_and_decisions.php?utm_source=feedburner&amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+scienceblogs%2FYsBw+%28Neurophilosophy%29&quot;&gt;embodied cognition&lt;/a&gt;, this concept basically claims that our sensual experience of touching and feeling has an effect on our judgment and decision making processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last shot of the movie involves the totem concept, and leaves the viewer questioning whether Cobb was still dreaming or had finally concurred his subconscious and made it back home in reality. Some have said that Cobb was still dreaming because the top did not fall, while some have cursed Nolan for not answering the question more directly. In my opinion, I think Cobb had successfully made it to reality and the reason Nolan left the question unanswered was to make the point that our realities and dreams are not as bifurcated as we would imagine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all, after 2 viewings, I am still finding myself thinking about some of the concepts in the film. I would not go as far as to say it is Nolan’s best work, but I certainly think it lived up to and surpassed the expectations I had for it. I’m happy to be experiencing Nolan’s rise to one of the best film-makers of our time first hand.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I was listening to this week’s episode of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thisamericanlife.org/&quot;&gt;This American Life&lt;/a&gt;, on the topic of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/102/road-trip?bypass=true&quot;&gt;Road-trips&lt;/a&gt; (a &lt;a href=&quot;http://samarthbhaskar.wordpress.com/2010/01/05/on-travel/&quot;&gt;topic after my own heart&lt;/a&gt;), and it brought me to some thoughts that I’ve been having for a while, but could not exactly verbalize until hearing what some of the contributors to this week’s show had to say. All of the whirlwind changes I’ve been having the last few months really put me front and center into processes of transition that paralleled some of the most important transitions I have ever made in my life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transitioning to DC has been relatively successful for me so far. I started working for a new company, have a new place to live and a whole new city and surroundings to explore. I am very impressed with DC thus far. It has a sense of pride all its own and a character that I cannot yet describe but can certainly identify.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think transitions are interesting because they include a sense of reflecting on the past and hopefulness for the future. Bringing in the connection to This American Life, one of the contributors this week mentioned that he felt like taking road-trips presented an opportunity for change and growth and epiphanies, etc. And Ira Glass responded by capturing in a few words what road-trips, and in a larger context transitions, encompass -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“  . . . [w]hat a road trip stands for is hope, hope, that somewhere, anywhere is better than here. Somewhere on the road I’ll turn into the person I want to be, I could to be, the person I am.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was on a run while listening to this, and I found myself boosted with a sense of newfound energy because what he had just said captured exactly what I have been feeling recently. I think this transition to DC, to a new company and to a new chapter in my life is another chance for me to develop the person I will be in the future. That may sound really obvious, but I find it to be an important thing to take into consideration at the beginning of a new endeavor, and to remind myself of throughout the endeavor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have also been using the Metro system a lot, to commute to work, to make my way around the city and because I love public transportation on its own merit. While on the metro I have been consuming a lot of great media, so I think I’d like to share some of the highlights in case any readers are interested. Here are a few top picks from this last week –&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subiza&quot;&gt;Delorean’s Subiza&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ll probably start making a habit of putting up some highlights of what I&#39;ve been listening to throughout this summer. A couple of hours a day on the Metro can really make great time for listening, absorbing and thinking.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>To New Beginnings</title>

   <updated>2010-05-21T20:37:59-04:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/to-new-beginnings</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;After writing my last post about looking forward to many different new adventures coming up shortly for me, I suppose it would only be appropriate to start the newest of these adventures off with a post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Monday I will be starting my summer internship with &lt;a href=&quot;gqrr.com&quot;&gt;Greenberg Quinlan Rosner Research&lt;/a&gt; in Washington D.C. Although I have yet to be introduced to my co-workers and the office, I am really looking forward to working in a dynamic and progressive office during midterm season. I foresee my time there going by very fast, but I also hope to get some valuable insights into an industry that I have been training myself for, for quite some time now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will be living with a family friend in &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bethesda,_Maryland&quot;&gt;Bethesda, MD&lt;/a&gt; and commuting into metro DC for work every day. Besides the work itself, which will obviously be occupying most of my time, I am excited to spend evenings and weekends exploring the city of Washington DC and the surrounding areas. I also hope to do a little traveling around the East Coast, time and money permitting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although I am clearly excited to be spending the summer in DC with a great new professional opportunity, there is a part of me that will miss home more than I realized I would. Perhaps because I was more than &lt;a href=&quot;http://samarthbhaskar.wordpress.com/2010/01/02/study-abroad-in-dubai-uae/&quot;&gt;ready to leave for Dubai&lt;/a&gt; in January, perhaps because this new adventures comes at the heels of another incredible one or perhaps because I found new reasons to like Bloomington, whatever the reason, there is a part of me that will miss Bloomington more this time around. In all honesty, I never thought I would be saying that. But as I have learned throughout this year – never say never.  At the end of the day, this makes me realize once again, that beginnings do not require new locations, new adventures, leaving home or any of these things, they can happen at any time if you are willing to let them.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Some thoughts on endings</title>
   <link href="/blog/dubai/some-thoughts-endings/"/>
   <updated>2010-05-03T18:02:01-04:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/dubai/some-thoughts-endings</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I recently finished my semester in Dubai, and returned home to Bloomington-Normal, Illinois. I have had some time to reflect on my semester abroad, all of my wonderful experiences, finishing my undergraduate career and endings, in general.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the last week or so of my time in Dubai, a lot of my friends (in Dubai and here at home) asked me in one form or another if I was sad about ending my time abroad and going back home. My gut instinct, and how I truly feel, was that I really was not sad at all, but I was asked so many times that I eventually had to come up with reasons why I wasn’t sad. I ultimately figured out that it was because I have a lot of really exciting things coming up in my future, not the least of which is the graduate program I will be entering into this fall at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://mapss.uchicago.edu/why_mapss/individualized_programs.shtml#&quot;&gt;University of Chicago&lt;/a&gt;. That helped bring some excitement to the prospect of ending an otherwise amazing experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to what is to come, I also couldn’t get myself to be sad about my time in Dubai ending because I had such an amazing experience. I know common logic would say that if I enjoyed everything so much, shouldn’t I be sad that there is no possibility of more such amazing things happening, on account of my time there ending. Although that is certainly true, I am more interested in reflecting positively on time well-spent than ruminating on what could have been.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My time in Dubai is not the only important “ending” that has been on my mind as of late. I will also be graduating from the University of Illinois in a couple of weeks. Traditionally, the graduation ceremonies are called commencement ceremonies, and that is how I prefer to think of them. Starting a graduate program after graduation, moving to a new city and looking forward to new adventures is really the proper way to cap up my time at U of I. I think it is the best way for me to pay homage to all the people and organizations that have had a profound impact on my time spent as an undergraduate there. All the enriching experiences I have had as an undergraduate have shaped what is to come for me in the future and my future is the best way for me to make the most of my past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I stumbled upon a bag of cards while cleaning my room yesterday. It happened to be full of cards I received when I graduated high school in 2006. Most of them reminded me how close I was with my friends in high school; I was truly blessed in that sense. And then I happened to open a card from a friend who passed away last winter in a car crash and it suddenly sobered all of these elated emotions I’ve been feeling. Seeing his message, reading his hand-writing and seeing his name really put all of these experiences into perspective. I truly believe that the impermanence of life is what makes it so valuable. As in the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0140449191?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=slatmaga-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0140449191&quot;&gt;Epic of Gilgamesh&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; when the Goddess Siduri tells the protagonist this is it, we only get one life (after he has harrowed many adventures to reach heaven and ask about the true meaning of life). She says &quot;love the child who holds you by the hand, and give your wife pleasure in your embrace,&quot; I hope to embrace the past that I have been given and work for the future that I am not guaranteed.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>My Love for Culinary Tourism</title>
   <link href="/blog/dubai/middle%20east/my-love-for-culinary-tourism/"/>
   <updated>2010-04-20T18:15:38-04:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/dubai/middle%20east/my-love-for-culinary-tourism</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I have been fortunate enough to do a bit of traveling during my semester here in Dubai. All of my trips have had one tying theme, which was partly unintended but mostly a conscious decision for me – and that has been eating. I have realized that, as of now, &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culinary_tourism&quot;&gt;culinary or food tourism&lt;/a&gt; is my favorite way to engage with a new place. Below are some of my favorite eating experiences from the past few months in the region. Not all were as amazing as the rest, not all have as special a place in my heart, but all have contributed to some of the best experiences of recent memory for me and colored my time in the Middle East in its own unique way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Dubai – Ravi Restaurant, Karachi Darbar, Antar Cafeteria, Bombay Star Juice Bar&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have some really great memories attached to food experiences here in Dubai. It’s a city for food-lovers. Since I’m on a student budget, I couldn’t really explore the high class, gourmet food scene, but I definitely tried my best to cover all the local cheap eateries and they did not disappoint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ravi/Karachi/&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luiRIm9HESo&quot;&gt;Bombay Juice bar&lt;/a&gt; made for some of the best North Indian/Pakistani food I have had in my life and that is including India itself. The owners of these places know my friends and me by face and order by now and can probably thank us for putting their kids through college. Shahi paneer, butter naans, butter chicken and mango lassis were some of the staples, but I can honestly say there is not a bad dish on any of these menus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Oman – Yemeni Mandi, Roadside Biryani&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first foray outside the UAE in early March was a weekend stint in Muscat, Oman. After a beautiful day of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4Uj6VqIkF8&quot;&gt;hiking, swimming and rock climbing at Wadi Shab&lt;/a&gt;, we stopped by a gas station and there were a couple of restaurants attached. I was famished and went into a small café and ordered large quantities of Biryani. After hours of hiking on an empty stomach anything would have tasted good, but this Biryani was amazing on its own accord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later that weekend I was fortunate enough to spend an evening with some really cool people over Yemeni Mandi. It was my first experience and my best. Sitting on the floor around huge platters of rice, meat, chicken, yogurt, bread and sauces, eating with our hands and indulging in some great globally minded conversation made for a terrific experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Lebanon – homemade Kibbeh, Seaside 4-course sea-food, &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanafeh&quot;&gt;Kanafah&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lebanon featured some amazing homemade Kibbeh from the amazing family that hosted us for a few days in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ou9JNeABrmg&quot;&gt;Zgharta&lt;/a&gt;. After we made our way down to Beirut and the South, the food experiences really took off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Tyr (Sur in Arabic) I ate what was arguably the most amazing meal of my time in the region. It consisted of 5 courses of amazing Arabic sea-food. To try and explain everything involved would be doing complete injustice to the environment, tastes, company and overall atmosphere of the occasion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later that week, on our last night after going out in one of the best party cities in the world, I was treated to some of the best Kanafeh I’ve ever had while watching the sun come up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Bahrain – Chicken Tikka, &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandi_(food)&quot;&gt;Mandi&lt;/a&gt;, Chocolate Special K cereal, chai&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bahrain again made for some delicious food tourism, although one of the coolest parts was a box of cereal at my host’s apartment. I &lt;a href=&quot;www.couchsurfing.org&quot;&gt;couch-surfed&lt;/a&gt; in Manama, and one of my hosts was in the American Navy and he had a box of Chocolate Special K in his apartment. I found myself slowly eating through the entire box while watching trash American TV. It was a nice way to feel American for a bit, and it totally brought me back to my days of cereal eating in college and at home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also got to eat some amazing &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxbDy89-82M&quot;&gt;tandoor bread, chicken tikka &lt;/a&gt;in a nice park at sunset with some great new (and old) friends, and shared Mandi over some more amazing conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Kuwait – street shawarma, kebabs, Indo-Chinese, Tandoori chicken, home-cooked meals&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kuwait may have been the most all-inclusive food touristic experience of all. Pretty much all I did in Kuwait was eat, and it was terrific. Starting with shawarma  from a street-side restaurant in downtown &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsNTkf84Zvo&quot;&gt;Kuwait City&lt;/a&gt;, to a kilo of Kebabs, to Indo-Chinese Szechuan inspired cooking, to more amazing tandoori chicken, I can honestly say I ate more in 3 days in Kuwait, than I usually do in a week in Dubai.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I stayed with some family friends so I was also treated to some amazing home cooked Indian meals, including some of the best and most satisfying Biryani I have had.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Food and culinary practices are obviously part and parcel of a culture. Getting to travel was a great opportunity in itself, but coupled with these food experiences, it made for some very memorable times. I will say that my favorite part about all of these experiences was being able to share them with the friends I have made over the course of this semester. Some of these people I may have known before, but got to know better, and others I met for a short while but they added tremendously to my time in the Middle East.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am excited to apply these same practices and principles to places in the US as I move forward. My appetite, as it seems, knows no bounds. The inevitable food-babies await my food-parenting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ps: I would advise against blogging about food while hungry.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>The possibility of Arab Occidentalism</title>
   <link href="/blog/international%20relations/middle%20east/talks/the-possibility-of-arab-occidentalism/"/>
   <updated>2010-04-12T10:57:12-04:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/international%20relations/middle%20east/talks/the-possibility-of-arab-occidentalism</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In one of my classes this semester, Arabic Literature, we are studying a few pieces from an anthology of Arab travel literature, called &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/America-Arab-Mirror-Literature-Anthology/dp/0312229631&quot;&gt;America in an Arab Mirror&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, The collection tracks back depictions of America and the West by Arab writers including poetry, prose, short stories and other works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had an interesting discussion about the concept of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Power-Knowledge-Selected-Interviews-1972-1977/dp/039473954X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;qid=1271090952&amp;amp;sr=1-1&quot;&gt;knowledge and power&lt;/a&gt;, and more specifically the constructs developed by Edward Said in his famous work &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Orientalism-Western-Conceptions-Penguin-Classics/dp/0141187425/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;qid=1271091048&amp;amp;sr=1-1&quot;&gt;Orientalism&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. For those unfamiliar, a short summary of Said’s work would suggest that Western scholarship on the Orient (Middle East, Far East, etc) is not an innocent scholarly look into another part of the world. He suggests it is a scholarship laden with power relationships performed through a vantage of power, making the East an exotic entity, and not objective but hand-in-glove with power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This brought up the question of whether this kind of scholarship can turn the microscope back onto the West, and whether there is the possibility of an Arab Occidentalism.  In my opinion, Arab Occidentalism is unavoidable because of the points of contact between these two regions (the West and the Arab world). Even in a pre-9/11 world, these two regions have been in contact over economic, security, geopolitical and religious reasons. And of course since 9/11, the points of contact have been ever more apparent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two main schools of thought that exist within the study of Arab Occidentalism suggest that Arab’s view of the West is either informed by deep-rooted cultural, religious or historical beliefs or by American foreign-policy within the Arab world. However, I think a third category must be added to this list: Arab travelers within the West who write about the West from the inside, the most contemporary such writer being &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sayyid_Qutb&quot;&gt;Sayyid Qutb&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first glance, it is easy to say that Western Orientalism is far more consequential than Arab Occidentalism. Western Orientalist writers are often part and parcel with policy-makers, either by working in policy spheres themselves or heavily influencing the ways in which policy is formed. On the contrary, one would be hard-pressed to find Arab Occidentalist writers within similar arenas in the Arab world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I think it is important to consider Arab Occidental writing as it shapes Arab views of the West because these are the very views that groups in the Arab world play off of to promote their chosen image of the West. Taking again the example of Sayyid Qutb, in his work “The America That I Have Seen,” and &lt;em&gt;Milestones&lt;/em&gt; Qutb clearly sets up an image of America that informs the ideology of groups like the Muslim Brotherhood, Al Qaeda and Islamic Jihad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is easy to brush off Arab writings about the West because they are similarly essentialist as Western Orientalism yet lack the institutional power that Orientalism is associated with it, but I think we would be well-advised to still consider these works as they inform the larger conversation about the West in the Arab world.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>A Response to “Online Status Anxiety”</title>
   <link href="/blog/media%20studies/technology/a-response-to-e2-80-9conline-status-anxiety-e2-80-9d/"/>
   <updated>2010-03-29T13:27:16-04:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/media%20studies/technology/a-response-to-%e2%80%9conline-status-anxiety%e2%80%9d</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A couple of weeks ago Jonah Lehrer published an entry on his blog, “The Frontal Cortex” &lt;a href=&quot;http://scienceblogs.com/cortex/2010/03/online_status_anxiety.php&quot;&gt;his take on social networking&lt;/a&gt; on Web 2.0. I have finally gotten around to writing an entry on the matter, since a couple of things struck me in Lehrer’s discussion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. “Social software tend to quantify our social life” – this is not exactly an emerging feature of social networks, as Lehrer proposes. Having a list of “friends” or contacts and displaying some way in which the members of these lists are related to each other is a required feature to qualify a tool as a social software or social network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://jcmc.indiana.edu/vol13/issue1/boyd.ellison.html&quot;&gt;earliest definitions of social network sites&lt;/a&gt; (SNS) include 3 mean features. (1) Constructing a public or semi-public profile in a bounded system (2) articulating &lt;strong&gt;a list of others &lt;/strong&gt;with whom you share a connection and (3) &lt;strong&gt;ability to view and traverse a list&lt;/strong&gt; of these connections and those made by others in the system. So the fact that as we are maturing through the timeline of SNSs a few services are becoming more popular than others is not a factor of or has not resulted in the quantification of connections online. SNSs by definition require this quantification in some form or another. [I know this is a cheap shot at Lehrer’s piece, but I thought it needed clarification].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. “My worry is that our online social platforms both magnify our hierarchies (by measuring our friends, followers, links, etc.) and erase social distance, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.disambiguity.com/ambient-intimacy/&quot;&gt;[read: Ambient Intimacy]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; so that we suddenly find ourselves in the same monkey cage with a far larger number of monkeys”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**bold and hyperlink added**&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Staying true to his great ability to articulate complex issues and bring in great thinkers, Lehrer ties in one of my favorite Primatologists &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Sapolsky&quot;&gt;Robert Sapolsky&lt;/a&gt; (this &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrCVu25wQ5s&quot;&gt;speech&lt;/a&gt; by him comes highly recommended) and one of my favorite philosophers (and LOST namesake) David Hume to argue that because if collapsed space we are more aware of social hierarchies and what’s more is that SNSs enhance social hierarchies by quantifying our social networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although I can’t say I’ve never envied someone for an impressive and extensive social network prowess, I don’t necessarily think this is the only outcome of increased use of SNSs. In fact, I think this is one, albeit dystopian, result of SNSs. They can create anxiety among people, they can lead to a heightened awareness of our own social position and they can possibly create a new set of problems for us as social beings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I’m more inclined to believe that these problems are not unique to online SNSs or digitally mediated social interaction. As such, these are human concerns and obstacles that we have faced before and will continue to face as long as our nature stays on a similar socially-oriented path as it has. I recognize the point that Lehrer is making, which is that bringing in a new way to socialize (namely, online) brings a new set of problems for us to deal with. But I am more interested to see the  many new ways to exercise our social nature, to create new concepts like ambient intimacy and to further communication, which in my opinion is a fundamental human characteristic and desire. We have been faced with challenges through changing societies, environments, communities and technologies but we have succeeded (with a few exceptions) in finding use in these challenges and sometimes even altering the course of our progress through them.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Small Campus Experience</title>
   <link href="/blog/general/small-campus-experience/"/>
   <updated>2010-03-26T13:51:40-04:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/general/small-campus-experience</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;One of the differences in my experience this semester at &lt;a href=&quot;aud.edu&quot;&gt;AUD&lt;/a&gt; has been something that is not necessarily tied to the culture or location of Dubai, but more to the differences in the size of AUD and the &lt;a href=&quot;illinois.edu&quot;&gt;University of Illinois&lt;/a&gt;. AUD is a rather small university with a small campus. Compared to the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, my home institution, AUD could fit completely in of the small quadrangle areas at UIUC. Class sizes here are small (6-30 in my classes), there are not very many academic buildings, libraries or student facilities and the relationships between professors and their students is noticeably different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This carries with it some inherent differences, when compared to the collegiate experience I have had thus far at U of I. Being one of 40,000 plus students at UIUC really requires you to make your own place or run the risk of being swallowed up in the sea of faces and names. Here at AUD it’s pretty easy after a week of walking around campus to start recognizing faces (and beyond that, get involved in people’s gossip, a la high school).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been working with various members of the faculty and staff here at AUD pretty regularly throughout the semester to gain access to some of the media facilities located near my campus (mainly MBC and Al-Arabiyya) and they have been really helpful and accessible. Although it certainly took the initial impetus from my end, the ease of accessing these professionals and getting the ball rolling on this project was pretty remarkable. At UIUC on the other hand, without a great deal of courage and confidence (or even mere awareness) it is pretty easy to float by and find yourself on the graduation stage receiving your diploma.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t mean to attach any value judgments to these differences, just to point out the different experience I’m having at a small school versus the one I’ve had for the last 3 and a half years at a big school. If it weren’t for my personal goals and motivations, I don’t think I would have gained as much as I did from my time at UIUC. On the other hand, there is a limited amount of things &lt;em&gt;to&lt;/em&gt; gain here at AUD, given its small size and scope and overall lack of development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many more differences I could point out between these two experiences, but ultimately what is important is that these things would have been valuable to know in high school when I was deciding about college. I think I had the best experience I could have at UIUC and it was the best choice for me, but perhaps it just happened to work out that way. I think there’s also some importance in the idea of being prepared for life after college. The immersive experience that U of I can offer (often referred to as the U of I bubble) can really be distracting for the 3-5 years that most spend there as undergrads. As with everything this has its positives and negatives. It allows you to feel like you can concentrate on being a college student and gain a ton from all the experiences you’re having, but then it also brings with it a tough reality check when it is time to leave. I would just advise those with still some time left to continue to enjoy the immersion, but also keep the reality of graduation in the back of your heads. And to those who are ready to graduate: I think we can rest happily knowing we gained a lot from our immersion the last 3-5 years, and now we can move on to another community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will now be dismounting from my soapbox.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;But not before asking for your thoughts on the matter, so do share if you care to.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Middle Eastern Millennials Survey</title>
   <link href="/blog/middle%20east/technology/middle-eastern-millennials-survey/"/>
   <updated>2010-03-19T11:39:42-04:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/middle%20east/technology/middle-eastern-millennials-survey</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A recent &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.arabyouthsurvey.com/highlights.html&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; released by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.asdaa.com/&quot;&gt;ASDAA Burston-Marsteller&lt;/a&gt;, a leading Middle Eastern Public Relation consultancy chronicles the demographics, behaviors and attitudes of young residents of the Middle East, across 9 countries. This survey is the largest and most comprehensive of its kind in recent Middle Eastern history and provides some useful insights. This kind of information is an important insight into one of the most important segments of the Middle Eastern population. The Middle East is a very young region, by and large, and with its interesting mix between abundance of certain resources and dearth of others, provides an intriguing set of questions and concerns as we move forward into the coming decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the most interesting points, for me, are mentioned below –&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. The single most important priority for young people in the Middle East is living in a democratic country, followed by having quality infrastructure, and access to the best universities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. The rising cost of living, shortage of affordable housing, and unemployment are the top three worries for Arab youth&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. Despite the rapid acceptance by young Arabs of the digital age, nearly half of all those surveyed read a newspaper every day&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4. Two-thirds of Arab youth spend their leisure time in front of the TV&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5. Many young people’s spending habits are leaving them in debt&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6. The growing economic significance of the East, specifically China and India, appears to be influencing the way in which Arab youth regard the international community&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7. Today’s Arab youth consider themselves as true citizens of the world&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;8. Youth in the Middle East are evenly split on their preference to work in the government or private sector&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am particularly interested to see the reactions reported related to mainstream media use versus social networking use, given the attachment that young Middle-Easterners have to their mobile devices. I wonder if the future of communication in the Middle East is headed toward a different trajectory than it is in the West. It will be interesting to see how Middle Eastern youth embrace new media in ways that work for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>5 Days in Lebanon</title>
   <link href="/blog/middle%20east/5-days-in-lebanon/"/>
   <updated>2010-03-16T06:46:12-04:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/middle%20east/5-days-in-lebanon</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;blockquote&gt;“&lt;em&gt;Didn’t have my camera by my side this time; hoping I would see the world with both my eyes;  Maybe I will tell you all about it when I’m in the mood to lose my way with words.” – &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaA7b9UTX7U&quot;&gt;John Mayer, 3x5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week I took a trip to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/le.html&quot;&gt;Lebanon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/le.html&quot;&gt; &lt;/a&gt;for 5 days. We landed in Beirut on the 9&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; and flew out on the 14&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;. This was the first time I have taken a trip like this without really anything planned at all. I barely knew where I’d be staying, what I’d be doing or anything beyond the fact that I’d be landing in Beirut at 11:40am on March 9&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;. Below is what ensued and amounted to one of the best trips of my life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. We were picked up by my friend Grace’s &lt;em&gt;distant&lt;/em&gt; family who are residents of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zgharta&quot;&gt;Zgharta&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zgharta&quot;&gt; &lt;/a&gt;which is a town located in the North of Lebanon. What we soon found out was that Zghurta is known for a couple of things: their &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kibbeh&quot;&gt;kibbeh&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kibbeh&quot;&gt; &lt;/a&gt;and their love affair with their guns. The town is one of the strong-holds of Northern Maronite Lebanon. It is located about 15 minutes away from &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tripoli,_Lebanon&quot;&gt;Tripoli&lt;/a&gt; and is one of the most &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.habeeb.com/images/lebanon.photos/Zghorta-ehden-zgharta/Zgharta-ehden.138.jpg&quot;&gt;picaresque&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.habeeb.com/images/lebanon.photos/Zghorta-ehden-zgharta/Zgharta-ehden.138.jpg&quot;&gt; &lt;/a&gt;places I have visited. About 15 minutes drive away is the beach and 15 minutes in the direction takes you 1600 meters above sea-level to &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ehden&quot;&gt;Ehden&lt;/a&gt;, Lebanon which somehow managed to be even more picaresque than Zgharta. Near Ehden was where &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ou9JNeABrmg&quot;&gt;we visited a couple of the most beautiful churches&lt;/a&gt; and monasteries I have seen. We were invited in by a monk at one of the monasteries for wine, sweets and coffee. It was a terrific experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Living with a Lebanese family was a terrific, and truly once in a lifetime experience. They spoke Arabic all day long, so I was able to really polish up on my Arabic quite a bit and learn a lot of different words and phrases in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebanese_Arabic&quot;&gt;Lebanese dialect&lt;/a&gt;. Their hospitality was also beyond belief. Everyone there treated us like a part of their own family, actually even better than a member of their own family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. On Friday we returned closer to Beirut and met with the External Relations Manager at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.aust.edu.lb/&quot;&gt;American University of Technology&lt;/a&gt; in Jbeil, near Beirut. Marcel was a fascinating guy. He met my friend Sarah’s mom at a conference in the U.S. last year and exchanged contact information. Sarah had contacted him via e-mail and he was gracious enough to invite us to his office while we were in Lebanon. Once we got a tour of AUT, Marcel was gracious enough to take the rest of the day off to drive us around &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byblos&quot;&gt;Byblos&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byblos&quot;&gt; &lt;/a&gt;and Jbeil. He even bought us &lt;a href=&quot;http://almashriq.hiof.no/lebanon/500/550/551/abisaad/&quot;&gt;300 million year old fossils&lt;/a&gt;. Marcel was a very intelligent and candid source of insight about Lebanese political, civil and social life. He also offered to set up prestigious internships for Grace and Sarah with the likes of the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.un.org/&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:normal;&quot;&gt;UN&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.undp.org/&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:normal;&quot;&gt;UNDP &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;and other very impressive NGOs in Lebanon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. Then we met up with some other friends in Beirut near the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.aub.edu.lb/&quot;&gt;American University of Beirut&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;By a pretty extraordinary turn of events my friend Grace’s Arabic class from back in Alabama were pretty much all in Beirut the same weekend, including their teacher who is a resident of Beirut, so we spent a couple of days with them. Our hosts were so gracious as to take us on a tour of South Lebanon (to Saida and Tyr) where we ate a delicious 4 course sea food meal, saw beautiful towns and country side along the coast and met some really wonderful people. After returning to Beirut we got to check out the famous Beirut nightlife, and in my opinion, it was in contention with Las Vegas as some of the best nightlife I’ve gotten to partake in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4. On our last full day, we met up with yet another friend. Grace (she was coincidently named that, so I will refer to her as Lebanese Grace from now) was yet another amazing host, which fit rather appropriately into the theme of the week. She showed us around Downtown Beirut and other amazing parts of the city. We then parted ways with her for a couple of hours, during which I was surprised by my friends for my birthday. They got me 2 delicious chocolate cakes and some delicious chocolate &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tasteofbeirut.com/2009/09/booza-haleeb-ma-fustok-milk-ice-cream-with-sahlab-pistachios/&quot;&gt;booza&lt;/a&gt;, needless to say, I was a happy birthday boy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We later went to sing karaoke and then to another nightclub with Lebanese Grace and her friends from AUB and LAU. Sparing a few details, we ended up eating, driving and hanging out with some of the nicest and most genuine people the entire night, until 10am the next morning when we were driven to the airport to catch our flight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If it isn’t clear by my tone in this post, I truly had a trip of a lifetime. Everyone we met, all the things we got to do all came together to create a beautiful picture of an already beautiful country. Lebanon has a storied colonial, post-colonial, confessional, political and international history but to spend time gaining an appreciation for the people and places that have hosted these histories was really what made this trip a once in a lifetime opportunity. I am glad to have made so many new friends that there really is no reason for me not to go back and visit again someday, and I certainly hope I will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh – and my camera was broken, so no pictures. Trust me, I’m more upset about it than you’d imagine. But hopefully I’ll get it fixed soon.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Dubai, Abu-Dhabi and the UAE</title>
   <link href="/blog/dubai/international%20relations/middle%20east/politics/dubai-abu-dhabi-and-the-uae/"/>
   <updated>2010-03-01T09:18:20-05:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/dubai/international%20relations/middle%20east/politics/dubai-abu-dhabi-and-the-uae</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Last weekend I visited &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abu_Dhabi&quot;&gt;Abu-Dhabi&lt;/a&gt;. It was about a 2 hour bus-ride from Dubai and only 20 AED (about $6 USD). It was a nice opportunity to get outside of Dubai and check out another part of the UAE. Abu-Dhabi, the city,  is the capitol of the United Arab Emirates and the emirate of the same name is the largest emirate in the federation. Below are some interesting facts about Abu-Dhabi, Dubai, the relationship between these cities and the UAE in general.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abu-Dhabi&lt;/strong&gt;: As I could notice while I was there, Abu-Dhabi seems far less developed than Dubai. Without &lt;a href=&quot;http://samarthbhaskar.wordpress.com/2010/01/11/first-impressions-of-dubai/&quot;&gt;describing more how glamorous Dubai is&lt;/a&gt;, suffice it to say that Abu-Dhabi was not nearly as glamorous. I walked around Corniche Road, which is the main tourist area including the beach front, saw some parts of the business and downtown district and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheikh_Zayed_Mosque&quot;&gt;Grand Mosque&lt;/a&gt; (which as it turns out is the World’s third largest mosque, with number 1 and 2 being in Mecca and Medina in Saudi Arabia).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although Abu-Dhabi seemed less over-the-top than Dubai, it in fact is home to more than 90% of the country’s oil revenues. It is by far the richest city and emirate, so much so that it provides a majority of the budget-needs of some of the smaller emirates. Culturally, Abu-Dhabi has tried for a long time to keep a distant relationship between itself and Dubai. According to Davidson (citation below), Abu-Dhabi has always had a tremendous amount of stability because of its oil revenues (let’s just say that certain estimates put per capita GDP in Abu-Dhabi near $275,000). This has allowed Abu-Dhabi to continue a steady sense of growth, instead of taking the risks that Dubai has taken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dubai:&lt;/strong&gt; As a city and an emirate, Dubai has taken some incredible risks in its history. From opening up&lt;a href=&quot;http://sso.dubaitrade.ae/sso/jsp/custom/login-ex.jsp?site2pstoretoken=v1.4~88EA867F~C0DB3FC9C5B06BBE55E5A5F23CC7C533B8D17905BBB370554A858C1E760A4EDBBBF6900982FB680AC0FAC7FAFF44EBD352588E048B4962AE2AFA0F6051CECE2C32FB2D8A43C76F2F3957F597AA4A1D9F81A8033B551CF8F9DC6966C6983D11234C3FA5F436840A3EA3BC3BAFAA2426C86BFCBD5B352852662B46BF47E555EB4E8398ED2AB3FA0F4F5F44AC2F37DEA494D6BC41355BA92603F439309FD5DE12BAAEC4C231D4F500A20D8B29AA0C1D0F2F2DBFD319C4F016499273152B1335B806&amp;amp;p_error_code=&amp;amp;p_submit_url=http://sso.dubaitrade.ae/sso/auth&amp;amp;p_cancel_url=http://pilot.dubaitrade.ae:80&amp;amp;ssousername=&quot;&gt; ports and free zones &lt;/a&gt;for foreign investment to investing heavily in the tourism industry to antagonizing its cultural partners in other emirates and Gulf states in order to please expatriates, Dubai has seen a dynamic development to reach where it is today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Between Dubai and Abu-Dhabi:&lt;/strong&gt; Essentially, these are the two emirates of 7 in UAE that really matter the most. Dubai is the social, financial and international capitol and Abu-Dhabi the economic, financial and cultural capitol (although the culture point is arguable, because Dubai has a culture of its own). Although Dubai and UAE have been at odds over many issues at times, they are at the end of the day, still very closely related and will continually come to each other’s aid in times of need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UAE as a model is fascinating because although it is a federation each emirate really has a great deal of autonomy, and even as a federation only one emirate (ruling family in essence) controls the majority of legislation, policy, finance, etc.  I’d highly recommend looking up the Davidson article, as well as some of his other works, if you find yourself interested in learning more about UAE.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>What do Tehran and “Precious” have in common?</title>
   <link href="/blog/middle%20east/movies/what-do-tehran-and-e2-80-9cprecious-e2-80-9d-have-in-common/"/>
   <updated>2010-02-19T05:53:24-05:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/middle%20east/movies/what-do-tehran-and-%e2%80%9cprecious%e2%80%9d-have-in-common</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I came back home after class in the afternoon and my roommate was watching “&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0929632/&quot;&gt;Precious&lt;/a&gt;,” the 2009 &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0200005/&quot;&gt;Lee Daniels&lt;/a&gt; film starring Gabourey Sidibe and Mo’Nique. “Precious” or the full title “Precious: Based on the Novel Push by Sapphire” is the story of a young girl in Harlem subjected to terrible tortures by her mother and her mother’s boyfriend, lost in the education system, becoming a mother herself and having been all but given up on by everyone. Daniels paints one of the bleakest pictures every captured on film, and moves it along very painstakingly by letting the audience hang on to the slightest sense of hope for Precious. For those who have yet to see the film, I highly recommend it but you should know full and well what you’re getting yourself into, it will likely weigh heavy on your mind for a while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After my roommate finished watching the film, we struck up a conversation about how powerful the film really was. Throughout the conversation he mentioned some really intriguing things. He mentioned that the movie had a really personal effect on him. He recalled many of his cousins and friends whom he has lost to crystal meth and other drugs, back in Tehran. He equated Tehran to the scene in the film when the social worker comes to Mary’s (Mo’Nique) apartment for a home visit. He said Tehran was a lot like the family who put on a face for the social worker, to make everything seem comfortable and put-together, only to go right back to their destitute ways when the world stopped looking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My roommate (whose name I am consciously omitting) said that he had a hard time getting through the film because it hit home for him in so many ways. And that really struck me. A film made about Harlem, &lt;a href=&quot;http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20091104/REVIEWS/911059999&quot;&gt;about the African American experience in modern day United States&lt;/a&gt;, about social neglect of a systemic problem, about forgotten individuals ended up evoking empathy from someone from another part of the world. My roommate went on to tell me about rampant drug and sex abuse in Tehran, about the ways in which the social fabric of the city has been falling apart recently. He mentioned stories about police officers watching as people were being beaten on the streets because criminals aren’t worth their time, about drug dealing and drug abuse among high school students and sex workers around the city. For an Islamic Republic with reputedly state control over so many facets of life, some of the stories he mentioned were truly shocking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was fascinating to talk to him about the impact of films in his life, because they’ve been such an important part of my life. There were a lot of reasons I loved “Precious” when I first saw it but this certainly adds to its prestige, as far as I’m concerned. A film that can so truly plug into humanity by discussing, in the most honest of ways, some of the worst parts of humanity certainly achieves some of the intended (and unintended) purposes of culture and art and furthers humanity itself. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

   <title>Business Law in the UAE</title>
   <link href="/blog/dubai/middle%20east/talks/business-law-in-the-uae/"/>
   <updated>2010-02-12T03:32:53-05:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/dubai/middle%20east/talks/business-law-in-the-uae</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A couple of days ago I attended a lecture on campus on business law in the UAE. It was an interesting, albeit visceral, look at the way commercial transactions law works in the UAE. As I am largely unfamiliar with business law on the whole so I can’t exactly compare it to anything else, but it was interesting in and of itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below are some of the main take-home points I took from the lecture:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Civil vs Common Law&lt;/strong&gt;: UAE has a civil law system which, unlike common law, is not based on judicial precedent. So a judge’s decision is not binding for all following judges, but because of the way the judicial system is set up, senior judges most often abide by certain principles which bring cohesion to the system of law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Different types of companies&lt;/strong&gt;: UAE law outlines 7 types of companies, all of which have varying types of liabilities and thereby are held to different standards under different laws.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Future changes:&lt;/strong&gt; since the UAE is such a young country, its only appropriate that it will be going through changes as it makes it way out of its embryonic stages. One of the major changes upcoming is the possibility of 100% ownership for expatriates. This is as a result of some mounting international pressure (WTO etc) that are calling for UAE to allow for more foreign investments (especially outside the free zones, which already have high rates of foreign investment)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, 50% ownership with an Emirati citizen is required. In the same breath, there is no path to citizenship in the country. So only UAE nationals qualify as citizens, and they only account for about 10% of the population here in Dubai. So you can do the math for yourself, 10% of the population required to fulfill that 50% ownership statute can create somewhat of a hurdle for new businesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since business culture and practices are so closely tied to the very fabric of this country, it was interesting to learn about the legal aspects of commercial entities. I’m sure as I spend more time talking to more people, I will continue to learn more about business and the strong hold it has in the Emirates.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Preliminary Thoughts on Google Buzz and The Diffusion of Innovations Model</title>
   <link href="/blog/talks/technology/preliminary-thoughts-on-google-buzz-and-the-diffusion-of-innovations-model/"/>
   <updated>2010-02-10T13:35:51-05:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/talks/technology/preliminary-thoughts-on-google-buzz-and-the-diffusion-of-innovations-model</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;After a while of just posting about Dubai, I thought I’d comment on something of interest other than my recent travels in the Middle East. With the new launch of &lt;a href=&quot;google.com/buzz&quot;&gt;Google Buzz&lt;/a&gt;, I thought this would be a good time to blog about social media. In specific I’d like to outline a new model I learned about and using the example of Google Buzz I’d like to comment on the diffusion of new media technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The diffusion of innovations model tries to outline and understand how new innovations permeate society and become efficacious tools for people to use. Although its origins stem from health promotion I think it can readily be applied to new technology and society, including new media technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The three main components of this model are as follows (in parenthesis will be how I believe these models apply, at first glance, to something like Google Buzz)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Characteristics of the innovation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a. Relative advantage (I think the fact that Buzz uses a highly utilized platform such as Gmail as its base provides an advantage)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;b. Compatibility (Google users are usually interested in aggregating their internet use, heck there’s even a complete OS being developed for Google users)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;c. Complexity (this seems to be a bit of a contentious point so far, although I think with feedback and some time, people will be able to use Buzz seamlessly)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;d. Triability (I think some early Twitter users fall off the board when they fail to realize its utility as a micro-blogging tool, rather than a life-caster, which could be something Buzz users might fall prey to)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. The Diffusion Process&lt;/strong&gt; (this is referring to the actual launch and dissemination of Buzz)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. The adopters&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a. Innovators (Google developers, people with high ranking Google accounts and relationships)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;b. Early adopters (Google users with wide-spread and meaningful social relationships online, who use Buzz effectively)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;c. Early majority adopters (moving more towards lighter users but still those with some social capitol to capitalize)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;d. Late majority adopters (still moving down the line of user status, but still among those who are somewhat engaged)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;e. Laggards (people who will not use Buzz at all, or expend any social capitol to let Buzz take off)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, I think Buzz is a worthwhile operation for Google. I know I myself, and my close friends have tried to find a way to share content in the most meaningful yet most comfortable way. So far it has been restrictive, whether through StumbleUpon, Facebook, Twitter, Google Reader or Google-Wave or Gmail conversations. Perhaps Google Buzz will strike that golden balance and have a seamless transition into my internet usage habits. For now, I look forward to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.com/profiles/samarth.bhaskar&quot;&gt;entrusting more of my life&lt;/a&gt; in Google’s hands.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>On Living in the Hyphen, and New Perspectives</title>
   <link href="/blog/dubai/middle%20east/talks/on-living-in-the-hyphen-and-new-perspectives/"/>
   <updated>2010-02-04T13:58:04-05:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/dubai/middle%20east/talks/on-living-in-the-hyphen-and-new-perspectives</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;blockquote&gt;“Receive with simplicity everything that happens to you” – Rashi&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being here in Dubai for about a month now has been a wonderful experience. As mentioned in earlier posts, I have met some of the most interesting and kind people, seen a truly global city and felt more at home than ever as a visitor. One of the best things that has happened to me here is my heightened sense of awareness of my own identity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I have spoken about before, this city is primarily comprised of expatriates, the majority of whom are of varied and multi-cultural backgrounds. Although I am an immigrant myself, and have split my life, thus far, between two lands, I feel largely American. I grew up in America, I became who I am in America, I aspire to be American and I surround myself with Americans. Being Indian-American or South-Asian American in the United States (something I hadn’t really embraced until college) provided some interesting questions and choices, but that’s not really what I’m here to talk about now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being here in Dubai has made me realize that having a colorful past and representing a hyphenated identity is actually pretty remarkable and valuable in itself. Being surrounded by people who speak multiple languages, have family around the world, or need a couple of minutes to answer the question “where are you from” makes me realize that living in the hyphen is not necessarily a place without a home, but a home itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I truly do believe that I live in the hyphen (although perhaps closer to the American side than the Indian side) and I’m pretty happy about it. It is an opportunity afforded to me and is a unique experience that I can call my own. Out of it I have acquired a storied Indian culture, language and set of memories as well as an American culture, language and set of experiences. I’m not interested in trying to portray some sort of balance between the two or a particular preference for either, but instead to say that I’m proud to have an hyphenated identity and living here in Dubai has made me even more proud of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While visiting a family friend tonight, I got to speak at length about Indians here in Dubai, local Emiratis and their (my family friend’s) experience living in Dubai for 30 plus years. It was fascinating to learn about the ways in which Dubai has rapidly changed, even in the last 10 years, the changes in leadership between Sheikh Rashid and Sheikh Muhammad, the ways in which South-Asians have prospered in Dubai, direct foreign financial investment and a multitude of other topics. It was great to get perspectives from a practicing business-man and his family who have been residents in Dubai for more than three decades. Some of the interesting points they mentioned were  the fact that although Dubai is considered “tax free” there are still many ways in which the Emirati minority maintains a certain level of control. Primarily through the policies of the monarchy, Emiratis have been able to enjoy the progresses made primarily by expatriates. For example, no expatriate is allowed to apply for citizenship or own a business without Emirati sponsorship. So, even if you are running a multi-million dollar business as a foreign national in Dubai, you are required to have a partner or sponsor of Emirati origin. Meaning that sponsor or partner merely signs his name (most of the time) and enjoys a share of your profits. Similarly, for a long time, foreign nationals were not allowed to own property in Dubai, so the large population of expatriates had to rent from locals, who received the benefits of booming real estate as thousands of expatriates poured into Dubai.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thoroughly enjoyed spending time with the family tonight and got a great deal of new perspectives on Dubai. I’m looking forward to taking these inquiries further in depth and seeing how I can understand Dubai better.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>On Multiculturalism and Hospitality in Dubai</title>
   <link href="/blog/dubai/middle%20east/on-multiculturalism-and-hospitality-in-dubai/"/>
   <updated>2010-01-26T12:28:29-05:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/dubai/middle%20east/on-multiculturalism-and-hospitality-in-dubai</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;If I had to pick one thing that I have enjoyed most about my time in Dubai (aside from the amazing food I’ve been eating, because let’s be honest, nothing would ever be able to top that) it would be how incredibly friendly and hospitable the people here are. I have noticed a considerable difference in social interactions here in Dubai as compared to back in the States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In reading and learning about the Middle East, I had heard that it was customary if you were someone walking into a room or a conversation already on-going it was  to introduce yourself and shake everyone’s hands (although this norm differs among genders). However, seeing this custom in practice has been pretty fantastic. It completely revamps and takes the majority of the pressure of f of social situations. In the US, I would say as a general assertion, social interactions as a young-adult are pretty confusing to master. Meeting someone for the first time, walking into an on-going conversation, entering a gathering as an individual, being an outsider can be reason for panic for some or (at best) require skillful social tactics for others. Here in Dubai, everyone (students, retail service workers, faculty, administrators, cab-drivers, metro/bus operators) has been tremendously friendly and welcoming from the get-go. I have made many friends around campus and found it very easy to join in on social groups/activities without much trepidation of being an awkward outsider, which is even more remarkable given that I’m a study abroad student.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This brings up another interesting detail about Dubai, and about me specifically. Being South-Asian in Dubai is like being white in the United States.  There is a huge population of South-Asians (something I plan on writing about more in depth at a later date), and consequently people assume most of the time that I am someone of Indian or Pakistani origin raised in Dubai and attending AUD. It takes some convincing and detailing of my life-story to convey to people that I am an American studying abroad here, like other American students. In all honesty, this situation is more of a blessing than anything else. I can usually get by with walking around the city without being noticed (which is something that most of the Americans, girls especially, who are studying abroad cannot afford to do). Although this city is by-and-large a safe place, being in unknown surroundings can make anyone feel uncomfortable or unsafe, but because I blend in I think I have a certain sense of comfort that many other study-abroad students would not have. In addition to this, I can also avoid (for the most part) being boxed into the normative American (or American student) identity. Which brings me to my last and most interesting point about Dubai.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There really is no concept of normative homogenous identity here in Dubai. In the US, at least outside of metropolitan cities like Chicago, New York , LA and so on, I have found that there’s no real guess-work when it comes to figuring out who people are (in a general sense) and where’ they’re from. Here in Dubai, I have yet to meet a person whom I can confidently say is ­_____ nationality or _____ ethnicity or of _____ background. I know all of these things are social constructs anyway, but my point is that the way Dubai has developed over the last few decades  it has attracted the most multi-national and multi-cultural of residents, creating new social constructs of its own, unique unto itself. Everyone I meet has an interesting life-story. Born in Nigeria, went to school in London, studying now in Dubai before going to the US. Or parents are Palestinian/Lebanese, can’t get a Palestinian passport so lived in Dubai for most of his childhood, went to Germany to find employment, kicked out because of Palestinian papers, back in Dubai for the time being. These are just the watered down versions and still I could go on. It has been wonderful to be able to meet someone new, learn about their varied and colorful past, and realize that in all likelihood, the future will be comprised of more people like this as opposed to the alternative. Some would argue that living a life like this doesn’t give you a sense of a home or a land, but I would say that living a life like this doesn’t bind you to a land that in turn causes you to alienate others or see them as opposites. Living a life like this makes you more cognizant of the (in my opinion) fact that we all ultimately share the same homeland.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>After a Couple of Weeks</title>
   <link href="/blog/dubai/middle%20east/after-a-couple-of-weeks/"/>
   <updated>2010-01-22T07:35:54-05:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/dubai/middle%20east/after-a-couple-of-weeks</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Below are just a few sporadic and random thoughts I’ve been thinking about Dubai and the Gulf in my first couple of weeks here. They are in no specific order, nor are they fully fleshed out, just things I wanted to say and more importantly hear from others about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. The rule of law in Dubai –&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dubai seems to have a very interesting relationship between the government and the governed. On one hand, the city is very safe. This, according to most of my friends here, is because even petty crime is severely punishable (a fact widely known by residents) which means even the thought of committing a crime has to be weighed against the possibility of being punished severely if caught. On the other hand, prostitution is rather popular and not much of a secret. On more than one occasion I have heard stories about students at AUD going out to night-clubs and seeing prostitutes crowd the streets outside, be propositioned by men (natives and expatriates, alike) and so on. Some of the working-class neighborhoods are even known to have prostitutes walking the streets in broad daylight without much concern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the same vein, a couple of stories have made &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/22/world/middleeast/22uae.html?partner=rss&amp;amp;emc=rss&quot;&gt;international news&lt;/a&gt; recently about Dubai and the UAE. One concerns a British tourist who claimed she had been raped at a night-club by a waiter, here in Dubai. Upon voicing her complaint to the Police Department in Jebel Ali, she and her fiancé  were arrested and charged with illegal consumption of alcohol and illegal pre-marital sex (with her fiancé who was with her at the police station and the night-club). Another famous incident involved the brother of the UAE’s president. Sheik Issa bin Zayed al-Nahayan was charged with brutally beating (including running over with an SUV) an Afghan merchant. The courts, citing the influence of prescribed medicine, acquitted Sheikh Issa of any crimes. Both of these stories have received minimal attention here in Emirati media. Although I have only been here 2 weeks, I would venture to say that if I asked any other students here on campus, or people on the streets, they would know very little about these two otherwise important stories.  I suppose at the end of the day the UAE is a monarchy, despite how modern it may seem with tall buildings, expensive cars and extravagant malls. And as in any other monarchy, your proximity to the monarch does mean the law applies to you differently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of the overall feel of law or lawlessness in Dubai, I think for the most part Emiratis and other natives have given Dubai up to expatriates and immigrants. One would be hard-pressed to find an area in Dubai that he/she could call the “Arab neighborhood,” while it is easy to point out Filipino neighborhoods, Indo-Pakistani neighborhoods, areas home to Europeans and North-Americans, etc. In becoming multi-national, I think Dubai has lost some of its own nationalism. While saying this, I am also keenly aware of the multi-billion dollar bailout that Dubai was afforded by neighboring emirate Abu Dhabi, so I suppose there is some level of camaraderie still left between the emirates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. The academic experience here at AUD –&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, I have found the academic environment here at AUD to be akin to that of high school. Students here seem to be far more interested in their cars, clothes and social circles than in the classes they are paying thousands of Dirham to take. As in high school, if you wanted to be engaged with your academic experience in a meaningful way, you would have to step up and take charge of it, otherwise it was rather easy to be another face in the crowd and slide through. Perhaps it was just my experience at U of I, but in the last 3 years there I found it to be more the norm to be academically engaged than to be disconnected. Since I am interested in making the most of my academic experience, I have already found that it will take a lot of initiative on my part to get more out of my classes than just the power-points, lectures, readings, essays and exams. Not to say that I am discouraged by this, but I am just recognizing the fact that a lot of students would not bother to take similar initiatives. At the same time, maybe I’m just too academically oriented and can’t seem to see past the student experience. Oh well, I like it, it works for me. And in all honesty, this is the time in life when I can be a student and be immersed in it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. Dubai Marathon –&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This morning I got to watch and cheer on the runners of the Standard Chartered Dubai Marathon. World record holder Haile Gebreselassie won his 3&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt; straight title in a time of 2:06.09. It was incredible to see an elite athlete like Gebreselassie complete such a feat of human accomplishment. Having completed my first marathon in October 2009, I can truly say it was an amazing moment to be cheering him on and watching him complete the 40 km in less than half the time it took me. I’m still awe-struck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll have more comments later, I’m sure, about these and other topics. In the meanwhile, comment so I can hear from you all.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>A few thoughts on Haiti</title>
   <link href="/blog/international%20relations/politics/talks/a-few-thoughts-on-haiti/"/>
   <updated>2010-01-15T08:12:47-05:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/international%20relations/politics/talks/a-few-thoughts-on-haiti</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;Are you willing to be a by-stander who says nothing as Nero starts The Great Fire of Rome?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- P. Sainath, 2006&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been reading coverage on the issue of the recent &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Americas/2010/0114/Haitian-earthquake-relief-Neighbors-help-neighbors-as-aid-trickles-in&quot;&gt;devastating earthquake in Haiti&lt;/a&gt; over the last couple of days, just like many of you have. I have read the numerous calls for actions, donation, sympathy, consideration and concern that many of my friends, colleagues and compatriots have promoted. I have found myself also wondering why there is little or no discussion of it here in Dubai, but then also realizing that Dubai, and the Gulf, has its own worries to concern itself with and is not as close in proximity to Haiti as the United States (nor nearly as tied historically). Throughout all of this, I still keep finding myself being concerned, not merely for those who have lost their lives and been greatly affected already by this travesty, but for those who have yet to be affected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an effort to clearly state my condolences to those who have lost their lives, their families and the suffering nation of Haiti, I want to state that I am only writing about this because I thought it was important and an appropriate time to consider such a topic. I certainly do not want to seem opportunistic or as if I’m trying to divert attention away from the needs of the nation currently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that being said, I would like to take up the important issue of disaster relief aid being poured into Haiti.  In 2006, as a freshman at the University of Illinois, I was fortunate enough to attend a lecture where famed Indian journalist &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P._Sainath&quot;&gt;Palagummi Sainath&lt;/a&gt; spoke about famine, drought and suicide among Indian farmers, as a result of the global food market and insufferable pressures. As an opening to his talk, Mr. Sainath spoke about the fact that stock and investment prices soared after the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2004_Indian_Ocean_earthquake&quot;&gt;tsunami that struck South-Asia in 2004.&lt;/a&gt; He posed an interesting question at the time, asking why it would be that stocks, investments and corporations would directly benefit from a natural disaster that killed and displaced so many. The answer he provided was humbling, at best. Mr. Sainath claimed that upon speaking to a friend of his in the investment industry, he realized that the benefits these investors were looking forward to and beginning to invest in preemptively were those they expected to trickle down from foreign relief aid. These investors realized that the world community would mobilize to come to the aid of those affected by the tsunami and provide millions of dollars in relief aid but ultimately, because of the way the system in India, Sri Lanka and elsewhere had been set up, the money would not go to help those in need, but instead would be used for the benefit of infrastructure and development in the corporate interests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this is the point that concerns me most about all the calls for foreign aid and relief that are being touted the world over for Haiti.  It makes me proud to hear about the money raised by the &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.forbes.com/digitaldownload/2010/01/haiti-aid-comes-by-tweet-and-text/&quot;&gt;Red Cross’s text campaign&lt;/a&gt;, or by private corporations and individuals or the efforts of the American armed forces and government. But I am ultimately concerned about how this aid will be used by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE60D5VB20100114?feedType=RSS&amp;amp;feedName=topNews&amp;amp;utm_source=feedburner&amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+reuters%2FtopNews+%28News+%2F+US+%2F+Top+News%29&quot;&gt;those in charge in Haiti&lt;/a&gt;. For now I think I’ll wait with guarded optimism to see if the efforts of the global community can really espouse local change. As Mr. Sainath has said himself in reference to Western Organizations, Capitalism and Socialism, “political opportunism and media management have provided the appearance of different choices and systems, without any meaningful changes in outcomes.”&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>First Impressions of Dubai</title>
   <link href="/blog/dubai/first-impressions-of-dubai/"/>
   <updated>2010-01-11T05:12:09-05:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/dubai/first-impressions-of-dubai</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:left;&quot;&gt;- &quot;&lt;em&gt;Ambition. Its the reason 208 different nationalities can live together&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:left;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style:normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;- &quot;You&#39;re a capitalist. Capitalize&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:left;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;- &quot;Ambition. It&#39;s the one thing economists don&#39;t have a chart for.&quot; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:left;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;- &quot;Markets fluctuate. Ambition doesn&#39;t.&quot; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:left;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;- &quot;It&#39;s not how much you make. It&#39;s what you make with it.&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:left;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;- quotes found in student publications around the AUD campus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:left;&quot;&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:left;&quot;&gt;I was flipping through one of the student publications I found on campus and I saw these quotes noted near the bottoms of some pages as style notes and they really captured how my first few days in Dubai have left an impression of limitless ambition on me. As far as exploring the city, I&#39;ve done primarily touristy type things for the first few days. I figured I would give myself some time to be a mindless tourist before I got sick of that kind of stuff and started looking for something else more engaging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:left;&quot;&gt;Malls in Dubai are an experience unto themselves. I haven&#39;t stepped into a single mall with the intent of shopping for anything but have still managed to spend large parts of some days there. So far I&#39;ve visited &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.malloftheemirates.com/en/Default.aspx&quot;&gt;Emirates Mall&lt;/a&gt; (home of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.malloftheemirates.com/en/Entertainment/SkiDubai/&quot;&gt;Ski Dubai&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ibnbattutamall.com/&quot;&gt;Ibn Buttuta Mall&lt;/a&gt; (modeled after the travels of 14th century &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibn_Battuta&quot;&gt;Islamic scholar&lt;/a&gt; who is the namesake) and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thedubaimall.com/en&quot;&gt;Dubai Mall&lt;/a&gt;. These malls are all far bigger, more luxurious, way more expensive and certainly intended to be all inclusive experiences than malls in the United States. Dubai Mall, for example, had a beautiful water fountain, a ice-skating rink, a water fall, an aquarium, high fashion stores, a gold marketplace, a 26 screen multiplex and more retail stores than I could begin to look at. Its location right next to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burj_Khalifa&quot;&gt;Burj Khalifa&lt;/a&gt; meant that I got to sit outside on a patio with a waterfall while eating lunch and staring at the Burj Khalifa. The incident of lunch (comprised of delicious Lebanese food at that) really captured my first experiences in Dubai.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:left;&quot;&gt;All in all, I&#39;m having a reaction similar to any tourist would. I&#39;m amazed at all the buildings, impressed with the lifestyle, dumbfounded at the luxury, floored by the opulence and constantly experiencing sensory over-load. If you&#39;re interested in seeing this in action, I&#39;d recommend watching any of my recent &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/samarthbhaskar&quot;&gt;You-Tube&lt;/a&gt; videos as they capture this sense of wide-eyed enchantment pretty well. While talking to one of my floor-mates last night, I realized that this is pretty much a typical reaction to Dubai for most people. He said he would ask me the same question now, as I&#39;ve recently arrived, and again when I&#39;m ready to leave in four months time. He then proceeded to ask me what I thought of Dubai. I answered with some of the same, talking about how elaborate I thought it was, the malls being so big and fancy, the buildings being so picaresque and so on. Rashid said that I answered as expected and as he expects, I will be very disillusioned by the time I leave in April.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:left;&quot;&gt;In truth, I knew all of this to begin with. I understood relatively well how lavish this city is, although seeing it in person certainly has its own merits. Dubai&#39;s reputation precedes it in many ways. Knowing all of this full and well, I still think there&#39;s something exciting about letting go of my nuanced understandings, my informed opinion or whatever the case may be and just taking it in at first with new eyes. I could have very easily been callous to it all and taken the attitude of &quot;well yeah, so what?&quot; but I think that would have been a disservice to my time here. I have been blessed with this opportunity and I intend on taking everything from it that I can. For the first few days, and maybe a few more since it&#39;s so dang fun, I&#39;d like to just be touristy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:left;&quot;&gt;As far as the quotes above are concerned, I think they speak loudly to something I&#39;ve been feeling about Dubai already, which is that all this expansion and luxury is relatively baseless. I haven&#39;t had enough time to formally develop these ideas or test them in any way, but my visceral understanding is that there&#39;s really not much underneath the surface of shiny tall buildings, big huge malls and &lt;a href=&quot;http://dubaimetro.eu/#section3976&quot;&gt;spaceship metro stations&lt;/a&gt;. Sometimes I think the buildings have been built just for buildings sake, not really to house anything as big.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:left;&quot;&gt;Some of the other highlights include the fact that I&#39;ve spoken more Hindi in my time here than English or Arabic. There are as many South-Asians here in Dubai as anyone will lead you to believe (actually, probably more). In terms of the financial crisis, I really can&#39;t say if Dubai has been hit hard or not since I was not here before, but from what I&#39;ve asked my friends here, the city is less crowded than it used to be as people have left after the collapse. The main remnant of the crisis I can see is halted construction of buildings everywhere. I am loving the food; primarily subsisting on a diet of kebabs, hummus, dried nuts and other meats. I&#39;ve also already eaten some of the best Indian food I&#39;ve ever had (including growing up in New Delhi). The infrastructure (highways, roadways, metro etc) is pretty impressive. I think this is a good case-study in what you can really accomplish with virtually limitless resources. There are some interesting media and public information access details that I have noticed (in newspapers and internet access) which I am interested in exploring further as time goes on. People here are really rich (I was behind a woman yesterday who purchased $6000 USD worth of makeup at Yves Saint Laurent).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:left;&quot;&gt;In any case, I plan on enjoying my time here and developing a better understanding of the country and the gulf region. I have some plans cooking for some travel in addition to my academic experience on campus which hopefully will be fulfilling as it has been the last few years back at UIUC.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>First day in Dubai</title>
   <link href="/blog/dubai/first-day-in-dubai/"/>
   <updated>2010-01-07T12:57:28-05:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/dubai/first-day-in-dubai</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Just a quick post after my first full day in Dubai -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last night I stayed the night at my friend Eeshaan&#39;s house. He was a huge help yesterday and today so a big thanks to Eeshaan and the Roy family! I tried my best to fall asleep but after sleeping 10 out of the 12 hours on the flight, I wasn&#39;t exactly ready to sleep again right away. So the goal of eliminating any and all jet-lag wasn&#39;t accomplished but I&#39;m hoping today&#39;s full day of running around and not sleeping a wink will help put me on track starting tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I moved in to my dorm room today. It is much bigger than even the triple I lived in my freshman year at UIUC (although not nearly as awesome due to a lack of great roommates like Ty and G). I have a bed, desk, big closet and a bathroom. My roommate seems like a great guy. He&#39;s from Tehran and we&#39;ve already talked a few times about Iran/US relations (more on that later...). He&#39;s into cinema and movies so we definitely have that in common.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got a phone today and will shortly be activating a Skype number so I&#39;ll be pretty readily available to those in the U.S. and elsewhere. My number here is +971503982969.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been driving around Dubai quite a bit and am absolutely amazed at the grandeur of the city. It is elaborate in every sense. I can&#39;t quite do justice to all my first impressions just yet (mostly because its late and I&#39;m tired) but I definitely plan on posting some of reactions to seeing the huge buildings, extensive infrastructure, sprawling shopping centers and malls, et al. Suffice it to say for now, every time I drive by the Burj Khalifa I can&#39;t believe my eyes and still think it looks computer generated even in reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time to get some rest for now and hopefully spend more time exploring the city tomorrow. I&#39;ll try and write a succinct and annotated update about my first few days later on this weekend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to all who have been posting, commenting and asking about my time here. Its always great to be reminded of how many people care about me.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>On Travel</title>
   <link href="/blog/general/talks/on-travel/"/>
   <updated>2010-01-05T19:43:52-05:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/general/talks/on-travel</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;em&gt;“All the lives we could live, all the people we will never know, never will be, they are everywhere. That is what the world is.”  -- Aleksandar Hemon, The Lazarus Project&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A while ago I read an essay by one of my favorite pseudo mainstream neuroscience researchers, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jonahlehrer.com/&quot;&gt;Jonah Lehrer&lt;/a&gt; called “&lt;a href=&quot;http://scienceblogs.com/cortex/2009/12/why_we_travel.php&quot;&gt;Why We Travel&lt;/a&gt;.” It put into a neurological perspective something I have felt for a long time. I have always had a particular penchant for travelling. As soon as I got my license as a 16 year old, I was always suggesting and trying to set up road trips. I spent a great deal of time in college travelling around the country with my &lt;a href=&quot;http://chaitown.org/&quot;&gt;a cappella&lt;/a&gt; group. Although travelling clearly has a very basic level of enjoyment attached to it, I have always felt like there’s something more that makes it so attractive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lehrer, in “Why We Travel&lt;em&gt;,”&lt;/em&gt; makes a convincing argument that travel is a natural human desire. He says that we travel because we need to, because it fulfills a natural desire in our minds. His closing line is powerful, for me – “When we get home, home is still the same. But something in our mind has been changed, and that changes everything.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first time I travelled under my own auspices was when I came back from India after attending a cousin’s wedding in the winter of 2004. I spent a 5 hour layover in Paris Charles De Gaulle (one of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cnn.com/2009/TRAVEL/01/12/worst.airports/index.html&quot;&gt;worst airports&lt;/a&gt; in the world, by the way), and started to appreciate time spent people-watching, strolling around, thinking and feeling unnoticed. One of my favorite parts about spending time in airports is the thought that no one is interested in who I am, what I’m doing or where I’m going. Although I’m not one to shy away from the responsibility that is associated with being a member of a community (communities like my home, school, friends, etc.) it is nice to take a break from it and enjoy a certain level of anonymity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have already spent more than 12 hours in transit since I left home this morning, and I still haven’t left the country. I’m sure many people would find this a cumbersome and frustrating experience but I revel in it. I always look forward to travelling, especially by myself, so much so that I dress up for it, ha. I enjoy grabbing a few books, having my laptop and phone with  me, walking around terminals, planning how I’m going to maneuver the security line (especially the moment where it goes from dormant-standing-in-line to a mad dash where you feel like you’re doing everything wrong under the watchful eye of big-TSA-brother).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the quote above captures very well and as Lehrer explains, I think travelling/migration/emigration all capture a certain level of humanity (heck, its even part of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hrweb.org/legal/undocs.html&quot;&gt;UN Agreements on Human Right&lt;/a&gt;s). Nothing is as humbling and grounding as the understanding that you are one small part of a larger reality.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Study Abroad in Dubai, UAE</title>
   <link href="/blog/dubai/study-abroad-in-dubai-uae/"/>
   <updated>2010-01-02T15:45:27-05:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/dubai/study-abroad-in-dubai-uae</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;The destination is much less a place than a new way of seeing things.&quot; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;--- Henry Miller&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/January_5&quot;&gt;January 5th&lt;/a&gt; 2010 I will be flying to &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dubai&quot;&gt;Dubai&lt;/a&gt; in the United Arab Emirates for a semester study abroad at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://aud.edu/&quot;&gt;American University in Dubai&lt;/a&gt;. This will fulfill my last requirement for graduation as an International Studies major from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. At AUD I will primarily be studying Middle Eastern Studies, including comparative politics, history and media as well as Arabic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was originally supposed to study abroad in Fall of 2009 but due to some last minute administrative mix-ups, I had to postpone my trip to Spring 2010. So finally, after what seems like quite a build up of anticipation, I will be heading off to the Middle East. This will constitute my most extensive stay abroad, save my current residence in the United States from 1998 onwards. I spent about three and a half weeks in Istanbul, Turkey my freshman year through a study abroad program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an effort to centralize all of my experiences and engage with my time in Dubai in a meaningful way, I will be using this blog to publish how I spend my time in the UAE. Readers can expect to see photos, videos, essays, ruminations, etc. here. As mentioned elsewhere on this blog, readers can also follow my &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/samarthbhaskar&quot;&gt;tweets &lt;/a&gt;from Dubai, subscribe to my &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/samarthbhaskar/&quot;&gt;Flickr &lt;/a&gt;feed, follow me on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.com/profiles/samarth.bhaskar&quot;&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; Reader or find out more about me on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.facebook.com/samarthbhaskar&quot;&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As means of a quick summary of my pursuits in the area thus far - I am an International Studies major at the University of Illinois. In my major, I have focused on studying the Middle East/Arab world with particular interest in political science, comparative politics, international relations, political communication, new media studies, sociology, gender studies and history as it pertains to this region of the world. In addition to my interest in the social sciences, I have taken six semesters of Arabic yet have barely begun to scratch the surface of this rather challenging language. Although being a native Hindi speaker did help in some ways, Arabic is altogether a complicated language unto itself and I&#39;m looking forward to furthering my study of Arabic at AUD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A little about Dubai - Dubai is one of seven emirates of the United Arab Emirates and holds one of two vetoes (along with Abu Dhabi) in the federal congregation. The majority of the Dubai&#39;s success was once built upon the oil industry, but now primarily consists of tourism, property and financial services. Dubai is considered by many as a truly global city because of its multi-cultural landscape, large expatriate populations and status in the world as a luxurious tourist destination. As such, Dubai will give me yet another experience of a city and culture on the brink (the others being New Delhi, my birthplace and Istanbul). As I found in my time in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Istanbul-Memories-City-Orhan-Pamuk/dp/1400040957&quot;&gt;Istanbul&lt;/a&gt;, the city of Istanbul and the country of Turkey were both in the process of forging their own identity as entities caught between two worlds. I&#39;m interested to see if Dubai, similarly, has developed an identity as a city placed in the Middle East yet exhibiting all the characteristics of Western life. Ultimately, I find this identity is an interesting case study in the way in which cultures, or as Huntington would say &quot;civilizations,&quot; interact. These contact points often serve as interesting anecdotes for how the larger global context may take shape in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an effort to stop the guess work, I&#39;ll leave the rest of my observations about Dubai for when I get there. In the meantime, I would encourage readers to comment and dialog on this blog as I spend the next 4 months in the Middle East. If I know you personally, I would love to hear from you. If we&#39;re not friends yet, I hope you&#39;ll comment so I can expand the scope of this blog beyond a personal-public journal.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Why I love Jazz.</title>
   <link href="/blog/music/why-i-love-jazz/"/>
   <updated>2009-04-15T18:34:55-04:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/music/why-i-love-jazz</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve been asked many times, by many of my friends, why I love jazz. I have always had a hard time putting into words how jazz makes me feel, or what I think about when I listen to jazz, or where my interest started (although most credit belongs to a select few high school friends). But even if I tried to explain all of these things, I don&#39;t think I&#39;d come close to explain how much I love jazz, and how I wish I knew so much more about it (besides just knowing about different artists, being able to glean different themes and appreicate improvisations).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just read Wynton Marsalis&#39;s &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Moving-Higher-Ground-Jazz-Change/dp/1400060788/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;qid=1239842803&amp;amp;sr=8-2&quot;&gt;Moving to Higher Ground&lt;/a&gt;: How jazz can change your life. &lt;/em&gt;His take on jazz and what jazz has meant to him really rung true in many ways for me. If nothing else, it gave me some good ways to describe why I love jazz so much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Available and understandable: Marsalis says that Jazz is summed up, sanctified and accesible to anyone who learns to listen to, feel and understand it. Although I started out not really understanding jazz, spending time with it and having a curiosity about it really helped me learn to appreciate it. Having a penchant for rythmic complexity also helped because I could listen to one song or one artist so many times without ever running out of new things to learn from it. This made the learning experience like breaking apart a piece of literature instead of just an aesthetic pleasure (although it had that quality to it too).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Opening up the core of a musician: listening to and profiling an artist has become a great hobby of mine. If you spend time listening to one artist (Coltrane, Miles Davis, Clifford Brown, Freddie Hubbard, Joshua Redman, Gregory Hutchinson) you can start learning so much about them. Spending time listening to one artist and learning about, what Marsalis calls &quot;the center of [a musician&#39;s] being,&quot; can make the experience so much more about the musician than what they sign their name on. This kind of signature sound and style is hard to come by in other genres (save some vocalists).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Improvisation: this is arguably my favorite part of jazz music, especially live jazz music. I am absolutely floored by the kind of skills and talents professional and even amateur jazz musicians command. The natural talents, coupled with the hours of training that these musicians put into their work, can create some of the most amazing works. Listening to just 3 musicians (a bassist, a drummer and a saxophonist for example) work together and play off of each other&#39;s strengths to create some of the most intricate and complex improvisations is a feat of human acheivement, as far as I am concerned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been surrounded by music since childhood, but in my young adulthood I have really been able to engage with it in a meaningful way. The role that music plays in my life has evolved just as much as my tastes in music have (those two are probably factors of each other, actually). I hope I can provide my children with the same kinds of appreciations for music and creation that I have been blessed with.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>15th Anniversary of Rwandan Genocide</title>
   <link href="/blog/international%20relations/politics/15th-anniversary-of-rwandan-genocide/"/>
   <updated>2009-04-07T15:10:11-04:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/international%20relations/politics/15th-anniversary-of-rwandan-genocide</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Today, April 7th, is the 15th anniversary of the Rwandan genocide. In 1994, 800,000 people were killed over a period of 100 days. That equals 8,000 people a day, for 100 days. That&#39;s more than 2 and a half times the number of people killed on 9/11, for 100 consecutive days, in a country with a population equivalent to New York City. 1 in 10 Rwandans were murdered and millions more displaced. All of this happened while the rest of the world stood and watched without interfering, because it didn&#39;t want to get its hands dirty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taking the example of then President Clinton, who refused to get involved because of the blunder that happened in Somalia a few years before, I think its clear that these mistakes were not a one time thing (Read: Darfur, Burma, etc). Referring to the genocide in Rwanda as &quot;genocide like events&quot; or &quot;instances of genocide&quot; instead calling it genocide in order to absolve himself of the responsibilities associated with genocide as a leader in the international community. Although he has come out and apologized since, its really to no avail for those affected by this conflict.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In memory of those who lost their lives, I think its incumbent upon us to hold our own governments and the international community responsible for these instances and to make sure things like this become absolutely impermissible in the future. Of course I&#39;m talking about genocide being  impermissible but also the apathy, indifference and lack of responsibility on the part of the international community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&#39;re interested in reading further about this event, here are a few of my favorite books and documentaries on the topic&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shake Hands with the Devil - Romeo Dallaire&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shake Hands with the Devil (documentary)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We Wish to Inform you that tomorrow we will be killed with our families: Stories from Rwanda - Phillip Gourevitch&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We did Nothing - Linda Polman&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Israel's New Administration</title>
   <link href="/blog/international%20relations/middle%20east/politics/talks/israel-article/"/>
   <updated>2009-03-29T18:04:30-04:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/international%20relations/middle%20east/politics/talks/israel-article</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Today marks Binyamin Netanyahu&#39;s first day in office in Israel. As expected, many have been speculating and providing commentary on how they think the new Israeli administration will fair, especially in relation to its most important foreign (and domestic) affair: its on-going conflict with Palestine. John Mearsheimer and Stephen M. Walt have written extensively on the subject (especially about the Israel lobby in America) and also chimed in on the topic recently. In an essay published in Foreign Policy Magazine (one of my favorite publications since my high school days), Mearsheimer wrote about what he thought the new administration would do in its tenure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also recently had the chance to attend a talk with Norman Finkelstein and Ali Abuminah on campus, and they spoke about the same topic, but more in reference to the historical context. Below are some highlights from both the Mearsheimer essay and the Finkelstein/Abuminah talk -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. Finkelstein: Israel has never conducted a war of necessity. All armed conflict has been a choice on Israel&#39;s part.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. Finkelstein/Abuminah: Israel has no reason to support a two-state solution because it benefits too greatly from its hegemonic rule in the area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. Mearsheimer: Netanyahu is expected to continue Israel&#39;s growth in the West Bank and establishment of a Greater Israel. He also is only expected to pay scarce lip-service to a two-state solution and will continue to conceptualize Palestinians as terrorists. (In fact, he has yet to refer to Palestine as a state).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, I found Finkelstein and Abuminah to be less than academic. Their talks were highly one-sided and almost refused to take a critical look at the actions of such organizations as Hizbollah (or Hezbollah). Abuminah, although not an academic, is a trained journalist, and was not speaking in a journalist&#39;s capacity, did not strive for any kind of a dichotomous analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mearsheimer and Walt, although I have disagreed with them in the past in terms of the Israel lobby&#39;s influence on American law-makers, did create an impressive question to leave readers with: What exactly is the benefit for Jews from Israel&#39;s expansionist policies? Although some would respond by asking why Israel needs to justify its political actions, I would ask in return, why the justification comes as such a burden when in fact millions of people&#39;s lives are in question.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Dead Aid - Dambisa Moyo</title>
   <link href="/blog/international%20relations/politics/dead-aid/"/>
   <updated>2009-03-25T15:16:39-04:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/international%20relations/politics/dead-aid</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I just finished reading &lt;em&gt;Dead Aid: Why Aid is not Working and How There is a Better Way for Africa&lt;/em&gt; by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dambisamoyo.com/&quot;&gt;Dambisa Moyo&lt;/a&gt;. I also &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theworld.org/?q=taxonomy_by_date/1/20090325&quot;&gt;caught&lt;/a&gt; her on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theworld.org/&quot;&gt;The World&lt;/a&gt; by Public Radio International on the way home this afternoon. After reading a little more about her, I can say I&#39;m truly impressed. Just to name a few of her accomplishments, Moyo has worked for Goldman Sachs, the World Bank and is on the board of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jbs.cam.ac.uk/research/centres/cibam/&quot;&gt;Cambridge University&#39;s Centre for International Business and Management (CIBAM)&lt;/a&gt;. She has taken macroeconomic issues and applied them to her homeland of Zambia and Africa in a very innovative way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below are some highlights from her book and radio interview:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. Aid is not helping Africa: Her take-home argument is that the $1 trillion dollars in aid that African nations have received in the last 50 years (really puts the &lt;a href=&quot;http://abcnews.go.com/Business/Economy/story?id=6022145&amp;amp;page=1&quot;&gt;$3 trillion dollar bailout&lt;/a&gt; in perspective) has actually hurt African nations more than it has helped them. &quot;Moyo illuminates the way in which overreliance on aid has trapped developing nations in a vicious circle of aid dependency, corruption, market distortion, and further poverty, leaving them with nothing but the “need” for more aid.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. Why must Africa develop differently than other nations?: Moyo asks why African nations must depend on foreign aid for development instead of following similar paths such as South, Southeast and East-Asian nations. One of her conclusions about foreign aid to African nations is that it is deeply rooted in a sense of pity for the African people. I wonder if there is some post-colonial analysis at work here, or if this alleged pity is just another sense of colonialism through rhetoric and pop-culture instead of militarism and exploitation of resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, Moyo calls for a hault to aid to increase economic growth in Africa. Although her call for a complete hault to aid (except humanitarian and emergency relief aid) is a bit much, I do agree that there needs to be a major recapitualation of how aid is delivered and used by African nations. This recapitualiation, in my opinion, needs to happen on both the side of the donors and on receivers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What&#39;re your thoughts? In a global economic crisis, are you among those who think stopping aid is beneficial for all, or those who believe a time like this is as crucial as any to continue aid?&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>iPhone 3.0 Software Updates</title>
   <link href="/blog/technology/iphone-30-software-updates/"/>
   <updated>2009-03-17T13:05:42-04:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/technology/iphone-30-software-updates</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Apple recently released the previews for the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apple.com/iphone/preview-iphone-os/&quot;&gt;3.0 iPhone software&lt;/a&gt; update. A lot of interesting updates were announced, at a pretty crucial time (read: Palm Pre&#39;s recent release). Although the updates won&#39;t be available for users for a few months, developers will be able to start developing new apps before the mass-release. Below are some basic pro&#39;s and con&#39;s for me -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PROS: 1. New batch of apps from app developers&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. copy + paste: Finally, this has been a long time coming. I have tried some of the third-party apps but they have been nothing much to speak of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. MMS: this will be a nice addition, although I don&#39;t find myself sending too many media messages via text. I&#39;ve been happy using the email functionality or posting media on the web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4. SMS forwarding: again, nice addition, but haven&#39;t really found a need for it in the past. Maybe if it&#39;s available I&#39;ll make use of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5. Multiple photos in 1 E-mail message: this is something that I have found the need for in the past. Looking forward to having this feature to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6. Spotlight feature on home page: I have about 5 pages of apps, so this will come in handy, although like most iPhone users there are a handful that I use most often.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CONS: 1. The most glaring con is definitely that there is still no-flash available for the iPhone. Hope this get&#39;s changed soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. I can see a hardware change coming soon, which means I will probably want to buy the new device. Which means I will need money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking forward to upgrading and playing around with the new software.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Iraqi Provoncial Elections - Juan Cole talk</title>
   <link href="/blog/middle%20east/politics/talks/iraqi-provoncial-elections-juan-cole-talk/"/>
   <updated>2009-03-12T14:34:12-04:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/middle%20east/politics/talks/iraqi-provoncial-elections-juan-cole-talk</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www-personal.umich.edu/~jrcole/&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;Juan Cole&lt;/a&gt; is a professor of Middle Eastern and South-Asian History at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. He maintains a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.juancole.com&quot;&gt;blog &lt;/a&gt;that I frequent and has been featured on many news shows as an expert on Middle Eastern and religion/politic relations.  He visited campus a couple of weeks ago and I had the opportunity to go to one of his talks, about Iraqi provincial elections and I thought it was a great way to learn about the historic context of the current political realities in Iraq. Below are some of what I thought were the take-home points from his talk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A.    Sunni and Arab Nationalism: Sunni&#39;s have traditionally been in the minority in Iraq but have maintained a hegemonic political majority. Arab nationalism privileges Sunnis and marginalizes Kurds and Shiites. Sunni Arabs benefitted disproportionately under the Baath Party (Hussein&#39;s political party)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;B.     Da&#39;wa Party (Islamic mission): this party was formed to emphasize and focus on Shiite cultural identity. They worked toward establishing an Islamic state, as rivals to the communist and Baath parties in the late 1950s and early 1960s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;C.     Supreme Council for Islamic Revolution in Iraq (Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq): this is a political party with roots in Iran. Wanted a pluralistic, parliamentary government with some sort of consultative council (Shura&#39;). Did not abide by the Ayatollah Khomeini&#39;s ideals of religious clerics themselves ruling politically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;D.    Failed Shi&#39;ite Leadership in the 1990s: led to a chasm, some followed Grand Ayatollah Ali Sistani, others followed Ayatollah Mohammed Sadiq al-Sadr (Sadr was assassinated by Saddam Hussein). Sadr was father of current Shi&#39;ite militia leader Muqtada al-Sadr. Sistani established the United Iraqi Alliance (an amalgamation of Shi&#39;ite political parties interested in gaining political representation in Iraq)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;E.     January 30&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;, 2005 elections: Sunni&#39;s did not vote (they were angry about US attacks in Fallujah) and ended up losing a majority of the provinces to Shi&#39;ite and some Kurdish parties. Fundamentalist/hard-lined Shi&#39;ites took over Southern provinces. Iranian Supreme Council for Islamic Revolutions won Diyallah province and Baghdad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;F.      Nuri Al-Maliki: elected Prime Minister of Iraq. Many ties to Hizbollah and other extremist political factions. Stood up to Mahdi army and has gained popularity for defeating them in Spring 2008, especially in Basra province.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Juan Cole&#39;s talk was very informative and his command of the region&#39;s politics came through during his discussion. It further proved my convictions that religion and politics have become (or have always been) inextricable from one another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of what the provincial elections mean for US/Iraq relations, I found that his main point was that hard-lined Shi&#39;ite parties, especially those tied to Iran was something that the mainstream news media in the US does not often discuss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I look forward to exploring this topic further and keeping up with Juan Cole&#39;s commentary on the region.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Welcome! To you, and to me!</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Welcome everyone!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today marks the day I expand my online presence onto a blog. I have been wanting to start a blog for quite some time and I finally have a reason to do it, namely, a &lt;a href=&quot;https://moodle.atlas.uiuc.edu/course/view.php?id=217&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;class &lt;/a&gt;project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just to give readers a general sense of my interests and what I&#39;ll be posting about, here&#39;s a short list:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Politics/International Relations: my main academic interests lie in International Relations, Comparative Relations and Area studies. With my interests primarily focused in the Middle East and the Muslim world, politics are obviously inextricable from the larger social context, so readers can expect me to comment on politics, sociology, religion, philosophy, anthropology, history, communication theories and media studies as related to the Middle East, the global context as well as the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Techno-stuff: In addition to my academic interests, I often browse and keep up with the most -recent gadgetry. You can expect some commentary on my favorite i Phone apps, new social media and Web 2.0 services, DSLR cameras and whatever strikes my technophilic fancy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Music: I am an avid singer and consumer of music. My favorite genres include &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.joshuaredman.com/&quot;&gt;jazz&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.davematthewsband.com/&quot;&gt;modern rock&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://ericwhitacre.wordpress.com/&quot;&gt;contemporary choral music&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.radiohead.com/deadairspace/&quot;&gt;alternative rock&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.johnlegend.com/us/home&quot;&gt;R&amp;amp;B&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.atribecalledquest.com/world/&quot;&gt;hip&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Star_(hip_hop_group)&quot;&gt;hop&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.chapter6.com/&quot;&gt;A Capella&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sigurros.com/main/home/&quot;&gt;World music&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://nusrat.info/&quot;&gt;South-Asian music&lt;/a&gt;, and a whole lot else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cool Podcasts I hear: I listen to many podcasts throughout the day so you can expect me to write about a few of these every so often. Some of my favorites include &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.radiolab.com&quot;&gt;Radiolab&lt;/a&gt; (WNYC), &lt;a href=&quot;http://http://www.npr.org/templates/rundowns/rundown.php?prgId=13&quot;&gt;Fresh Air&lt;/a&gt; (WHYY), &lt;a href=&quot;http://thisamericanlife.org/&quot;&gt;This American Life&lt;/a&gt; (WBEZ) and the podcasts from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.howstuffworks.com&quot;&gt;How Stuff Works&lt;/a&gt;.com&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other random stuff: I&#39;ll probably end up writing about random stuff that is going on in my real and online life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Places you can find me on the internet: &lt;a href=&quot;0px;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;!-- Facebook Badge END --&amp;gt;&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking forward to writing and more to hearing what you all have to say about what I think!&lt;/p&gt;
