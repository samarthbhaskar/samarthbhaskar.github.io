   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Lately, I’ve been participating in discussions (online and in person) about Black Lives Matter, police brutality, protests, and race relations. In one of these discussions, a friend brought up the frustration she feels when talking about these topics with friends and family who are less than sympathetic to the argument put forth by the Black Lives Matter movement. In her own words:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I feel surrounded by people who, I feel, do not fully understand the challenges black people face, and have faced for so long. They don’t get the implications of slavery, because well, “that was centuries ago and they should be over it by now. Black people enslaved other blacks in Africa. blah blah” Ugh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;But what it often boils down to is the sentiment that black people should just miraculously pull themselves out of poverty, unemployment, a broken family structure, poor education, a terrible criminal justice system, and go get a job. Because they, “we”, were immigrants and struggled, so why shouldn’t black people have to struggle too? Why give them “handouts?” “Why are the police to blame when they kill each other more often, and kill police as well?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I understand where these arguments come from, but I wish I could articulate and try to paint a picture of many of their lives and history so they can start possibly seeing things in a different light. Anyways, this is probably more of a phone conversation, but it’s just been on my mind as it’s always a sore topic in my house. And I’m not doing my due diligence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this in mind, I noted down this list of writers, books, articles, movies and music that came to mind. They have helped me understand race relations in the United States since I was in high school. I look to these and similar works to continue my education in how my country works. This is not a list of quick arguments, easy definitions, or flashy statistics. It represents an on-going education.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any such list is invariably missing something. Please recommend additions and I’ll update this post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Writers:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ta-nehisi Coates - probably the writer I look to most often for guidance on these issues. Start with the essays listed &lt;a href=&quot;https://longform.org/archive/writers/ta-nehisi-coates&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, especially The Case for Reparations, Letter To My Son (which is an extended excerpt from his book Between The World And Me), and The Black Family in the Age of Mass Incarceration.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;James Baldwin - the intellectual predecessor to Coates. Wrote mostly in the 50s-70s. His speeches and lectures, many on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnIjXmfTSYg&quot;&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt; (like his debate with William F Buckley), are sometimes even better than his written work.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Toni Morrison - a prolific writer, still writing. Song of Solomon, Sula, Beloved, The Bluest Eye are all great works of fiction. Her essays are great too. This &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/12/magazine/the-radical-vision-of-toni-morrison.html&quot;&gt;profile&lt;/a&gt; is also great.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.timwise.org/f-a-q-s/&quot;&gt;Tim Wise&lt;/a&gt; - easily digestible, often logically sound, but less academic. A good starting point, not least because he’s a white guy.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Jelani Cobb - academic and magazine writer. His long piece in the New Yorker this March on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/03/14/where-is-black-lives-matter-headed&quot;&gt;BLM&lt;/a&gt; is a good start.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Cornel West - he’s recently kind of gone off the deep end, but generally his writing is incisive, sharp and part of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/27/books/books-of-the-times-rage-and-reason-in-the-crisis-of-black-america.html&quot;&gt;canon&lt;/a&gt; of great contemporary writing on race relations. A profile &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2009/11/02/the-oracle-3&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Wesley Morris - sports, culture, film writer. But his essays are often full of commentary on more than just sports or art. Like this &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/17/arts/defining-and-proclaiming-a-new-black-power.html&quot;&gt;essay&lt;/a&gt; from a few weeks ago that’s chock full of insights about changes in black culture and new black voices.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;bell hooks - academic, cultural critic, author. Mostly engagaged with feminism theory, post-modernism, capitalism, but race shows up in her work everywhere. Especially &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/385655.Yearning&quot;&gt;Yearning&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Books:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Warmth of Other Sons, Isabel Wilkerson - Possibly the fullest and most complete chronicle of the great migration, setting the table for how blacks left the south, migrated and settled in the north, and built lives in the face of myriad struggles. The legacy of this 6-decade long migration is still present today in cities like Detroit, Chicago, Newark, etc. Review &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/05/books/review/Oshinsky-t.html?pagewanted=all&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Half Has Never Been Told, Edward E. Baptiste - the story of how important slavery was to the founding of this country, and why it still matters. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/05/books/review/the-half-has-never-been-told-by-edward-e-baptist.html&quot;&gt;Review&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Negroland, Margo Jefferson - personal memoir of a journalist, raised on the South Side in the 60s. Relevant as a middle-class counter point to narratives that tend to be about poverty. Which is to say, yes, poverty is a part of the problem, but even middle class blacks live different lives from middle class whites. I wrote about it &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1398305533?book_show_action=false&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Between the World and Me, Tanehisi Coates (as mentioned above). I wrote about it &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1341653747?book_show_action=false&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Fire Next Time, James Baldwin (the intellectual inspiration for Between The World and Me) Short. Fiery. Review &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nybooks.com/articles/1963/02/01/james-baldwin-and-the-man/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Actually, better review &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/books/98/03/29/specials/baldwin-fire.html&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Rap on Race, James Baldwin &amp;amp; Margaret Mead - a conversation in 1970, at the end of the Civil Rights movement, Baldwin and Margaret Mead had a 7+ hour conversation about America, race, basically everything. It is full of wisdom. An essay series on it &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.brainpickings.org/2015/03/19/a-rap-on-race-margaret-mead-and-james-baldwin/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2004/09/12/books/review/arc-of-justice-i-swear-it-was-in-selfdefense.html?_r=0&quot;&gt;Arc of Justice&lt;/a&gt;, Kevin Boyle - about some of the underpinnings of the criminalization of Blacks. That’s a huge issue, and perhaps the most important one, which as I look back over this list, is sorely under-represented. But the relationship between blacks, the justice system, policing and voting is especially important in contemporary discussions.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The New Jim Crow, Michelle Alexander - probably the best, most persuasive argument, in favor of seeing our current prison system as a system of mass incarceration, replacing Jim Crow and slavery before it. It comes up in basically every piece of writing I see now about #BlackLivesMatter, as well it should. Wiki page &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_Jim_Crow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Racecraft, Karen and Barbara Fields - an academic and popular work outlining how “race” was invented to serve “racism” not the other way around. Review &lt;a href=&quot;https://lareviewofbooks.org/article/coloring-outside-the-lines/#!&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Articles:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Racism, Birth Control and Reproductive Rights, Angela Davis (&lt;a href=&quot;http://artecontraviolenciadegenero.org/?wpfb_dl=3&quot;&gt;PDF&lt;/a&gt;) - another scholar and activist from the 70s who had a major impact on black thought. This article in particular is about how black women have been systematically denied birth control and some of the concerns of the feminist movements of the 20th century, like unwanted births or having to raise children out of wedlock against her will, are still disproportionately affecting black women.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.angryasianman.com/2016/07/an-open-letter-to-our-asian-american.html&quot;&gt;Asian American children’s letter to parents in support of BLM&lt;/a&gt; - although targeted toward immigrant parents, there are chunks of this letter that properly grasp the relations between blacks and other minority groups. There’s a lot to be said about the aspirations of minority groups to white privilege and how this co-opts otherwise sympathetic people into anti-black narratives.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A collection of contemporary longform essays is listed &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.longreads.com/2016/07/11/black-lives-matter-a-reading-list/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.

Including this collection of essays about &lt;a href=&quot;https://longform.org/posts/the-longform-guide-to-police-brutality&quot;&gt;police brutality&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Resources aimed at white readers listed &lt;a href=&quot;http://citizenshipandsocialjustice.com/2015/07/10/curriculum-for-white-americans-to-educate-themselves-on-race-and-racism/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

   <title>A Marxian reading of Technology</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Tonight I attended my first meeting of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jacobinmag.com/&quot;&gt;Jacobin Magazine&lt;/a&gt; reading group. Jacobin Magazine is a leading leftist magazine, providing cultural, social and political commentary from a polemical leftist perspective. The reading group meets once a month in Brooklyn and provides a semi-structured conversation for readers of the magazine. This month’s topic was technology. And tonight’s readings were &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jacobinmag.com/2015/04/braverman-gramsci-marx-technology/&quot;&gt;Technology and Socialist Strategy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jacobinmag.com/2015/03/socialism-innovation-capitalism-smith/&quot;&gt;Red Innovation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jacobinmag.com/2015/03/socialism-innovation-capitalism-smith/&quot;&gt;Red Innovation&lt;/a&gt; dealt with some of the anxieties the labor force currently faces, about being automated out of a job. It brought context to this topic by discussing the history of government investment in research and development, society’s role in intellectual property rights and generally proposing a social structure that would encourage innovation without realizing some of the anxieties of de-skilling, greater unemployment or increased inequality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jacobinmag.com/2015/04/braverman-gramsci-marx-technology/&quot;&gt;Technology and Socialist Strategy&lt;/a&gt; dealt with the topic of technology in a slightly different way. It brought to bear different strands of Marxian theory. From discussing Marx’s approach to technology (he was generally impressed with technology, but saw clear, inherent class based problems), to Gramsci’s Fordist romance, to the late-century English labor movements - this article was a much more textured look at technology’s role in labor force and social development. One of the main lessons I took from it, and from the discussion tonight, was that any technology reflects the system in which it was built. The technologies we live with today, and the anxieties they provoke, are inherently tied to the system in which they were produced. Conversely, technologies produced in a post-capitalist system might look, feel, perform completely differently. A question that could follow from this is - will new, completely different technologies possibly usher in post-capitalism? Or does the causal arrow only flow one way?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the discussions tonight, especially about technology’s role in government reminded me a lot of the general &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thebaffler.com/salvos/the-meme-hustler&quot;&gt;O’Reilly&lt;/a&gt; premise that with enough smart, efficient technology, government services can benefit everyone. This is generally a well accepted premise, and government’s not so secret love affair with technology is something we should look at critically. The same government that monitors our use of the internet, or phones, or deploys drones across the world to “accomplish goals in our national interest,” can easily be painted as a neutral, benevolent purveyor of technological efficiency for its citizens (cutting wait times at the DMV with an app, for example).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m far from a technophobe, but I also don’t view technology as a neutral, value-less force. Technology carries values, and we should be careful when we promote one technology over another or technology writ-large over no technology.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Economics after the Crash - A Discipline in Need of Renewal?</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Part 2&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A couple of weeks ago, the New York Review of Books Foundation held a conference about economics. The title of the conference was “What’s Wrong with the Economy and with Economics?” The conference featured academics and public intellectuals giving short talks and engaging in debates about modern day macro-economic trends. All the videos from the conference are available on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nybooks.com/blogs/gallery/2015/mar/29/whats-wrong-with-the-economy/&quot;&gt;NYRB&lt;/a&gt; site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next &lt;a href=&quot;https://vimeo.com/122574224&quot;&gt;video&lt;/a&gt; from the NYRB conference I watched featured one of the most prominent economist/public intellectuals of the day, Paul Krugman. Along with Benjamin Friedman of Harvard and Lord Skidelsky of the University of Warwick and House of Lords, this panel primarily addressed the question of economics and economists in the last 7 years since the financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All three panelists did a great job of digging into some of the assumptions and biases in economics that keep it from being a true science and from advancing the public’s understanding of the role of money, power and value in society. From age-old criticisms like econ’s inability to conduct true causal analysis, to its over-reliance on mathematical models, to the complete inability of economics to understand and model power, the talks and discussion were very fascinating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was clear, to me, that Krugman’s years as an Op-Ed writer have served him well in developing his ability to construct arguments using analogies, kitchy turns of phrase and emotionally grounded appeals that make him far more effective in this type of forum than his contemporaries. I’m sure some, more technical, watchers of the field might see that as a detriment to his role as an economist (don’t forget though, that he won a Clark and a Nobel in the field) but I find it an asset that the field could do more with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, a really strong discussion, featuring some very salient points and worth the time it took to watch it.&lt;/p&gt;
