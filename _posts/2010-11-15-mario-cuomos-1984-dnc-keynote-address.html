<p>A friend of mine mentioned this speech to me the other day. I had never heard of it before, especially with Obama's 2004 DNC address being the most popular speaking event connected with the DNC in my recently developed politicalÂ conscience. I finally got around to reading the speech and I had to share it. My friend described it as a "seminal piece of rhetoric in liberal political ideology" and I couldn't have put it better myself. I would have picked out parts that I liked best, but I am more inclined to promote it in its entirety.</p>
