<p>After writing my last post about looking forward to many different new adventures coming up shortly for me, I suppose it would only be appropriate to start the newest of these adventures off with a post.</p>
<p>On Monday I will be starting my summer internship with <a href="gqrr.com">Greenberg Quinlan Rosner Research</a> in Washington D.C. Although I have yet to be introduced to my co-workers and the office, I am really looking forward to working in a dynamic and progressive office during midterm season. I foresee my time there going by very fast, but I also hope to get some valuable insights into an industry that I have been training myself for, for quite some time now.</p>
<p>I will be living with a family friend in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bethesda,_Maryland">Bethesda, MD</a> and commuting into metro DC for work every day. Besides the work itself, which will obviously be occupying most of my time, I am excited to spend evenings and weekends exploring the city of Washington DC and the surrounding areas. I also hope to do a little traveling around the East Coast, time and money permitting.</p>
<p>Although I am clearly excited to be spending the summer in DC with a great new professional opportunity, there is a part of me that will miss home more than I realized I would. Perhaps because I was more than <a href="http://samarthbhaskar.wordpress.com/2010/01/02/study-abroad-in-dubai-uae/">ready to leave for Dubai</a> in January, perhaps because this new adventures comes at the heels of another incredible one or perhaps because I found new reasons to like Bloomington, whatever the reason, there is a part of me that will miss Bloomington more this time around. In all honesty, I never thought I would be saying that. But as I have learned throughout this year – never say never.  At the end of the day, this makes me realize once again, that beginnings do not require new locations, new adventures, leaving home or any of these things, they can happen at any time if you are willing to let them.</p>
