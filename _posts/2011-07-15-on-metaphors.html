<p>The Chronicle of Higher Education has a <a href="http://chronicle.com/article/Whats-a-Metaphor-For-/128079/">review</a> of James Geary's <em>I is an other</em>, a new book on the place of metaphors in language. This quote from Geary was well received -</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p>Metaphor conditions our interpretations of the stock market and, through advertising, it surreptitiously infiltrates our purchasing decisions. In the mouths of politicians, metaphor subtly nudges public opinion; in the minds of businesspeople, it spurs creativity and innovation. In science, metaphor is the preferred nomenclature for new theories and new discoveries; in psychology, it is the natural language of human relationships and emotions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p></blockquote>
<p>Although I wouldn't go as far as someone like Derrida, I think there is definitely value in the work of someone like George Lakoff who advanced the idea that metaphors are a conceptual (not merely linguistic) construction. His forays into political science, through things like conservative concepts of the paternal state versus progressive concepts of a maternal state, are pretty useful.</p>
