<p>In March of this year I was invited back by my graduate program, <a href="http://mapss.uchicago.edu/">MAPSS</a>, at the University of Chicago to give a short talk and sit on student panels about career development. The event ended up being a really great way to tie together some of the disparate pieces of my career trajectory thus far. I enjoyed giving the talk and especially talking to all the students I met afterward about their varied interests, my interests and all the ways in which we hope to contribute to the world, academically and professionally after obtaining our masters degrees.</p>
<p>Here's the talk I gave about my, albeit short, career so far. What I've learned, how I got here and what I urged students to think about. As I mention at the beginning of the talk, these are things I'm still thinking about and figuring out for myself, so this talk was less prescriptive and more an opener to a conversation with students who are also thinking and figuring these things out for themselves.</p>
<p>Addendum: I wrote a longer post about my experience at MAPSS, you can find that <a href="http://samarthbhaskar.wordpress.com/2014/07/29/a-few-words-about-my-experience-at-mapss-uchicago/">here</a></p>
