<p>Over the weekend, I saw Social Network and Catfish (back to back, in fact). It has been a while since I have been impressed with theatrical releases, so this weekend was a great re-introduction into worthwhile contemporary films.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1584016/">Catfish</a> is a documentary about an artist based in New York and his interactions with a family in rural Michigan. If I say any more about the film, I will invariably ruin it. I was fortunate enough to go see it without any idea what it was about (based purely on recommendations from my close friends) and ended up enjoying it a lot. Some things that are important to keep in mind are the fact that it is <a href="http://www.austin360.com/movies/catfish-makers-say-their-film-really-is-a-922498.html">100% real</a> and that there will be moments in the movie where you think you've gleaned the moral already, but you really <a href="http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20100922/REVIEWS/100929991">have to wait until the end </a>to get everything it has to offer.</p>
<p>Social Network was a terrific adventure in film-making. It had me hooked from the first dialog scene, and kept me intently engaged the entire time. I thought Aaron Sorkin did a wonderful job adapting the screenplay from the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Accidental-Billionaires-Founding-Facebook-Betrayal/dp/0307740986">Ben Mezrich book</a>, the editing and packaging of the film was terrific and David Fincher excelled in his role as a director (one of my friends whom I saw the movie with was bent on arguing that it was his best film yet).</p>
<p>With reference to the subject matter of Social Network, I thought the film-makers did what they had to do, which was to take a pretty complex set of events, and create a viable story out of it, to tell the audience. All the vitriol and backlash about inaccuracies and poor portrayals of <a href="http://gawker.com/5643915/mark-zuckerberg-describes-the-dirty-tricks-that-led-to-the-facebook-movie">Zuckerberg may be well-founded</a>, but that is not the purpose of a film, as a piece of art. One argument that I did find especially beneficial to read was <a href="http://www.tnr.com/article/books-and-arts/78081/sorkin-zuckerberg-the-social-network">Larry Lessig's reaction in The National Review</a>. He argues, in essence, that the film missed an opportunity to make some really important commentary on the nature of an enterprise like Facebook being so different from other successful enterprises in the past.</p>
<p>All in all, it was a great movie weekend, and both of the aforementioned films come highly recommended from me.</p>
