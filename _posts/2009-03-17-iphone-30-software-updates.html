<p>Apple recently released the previews for the <a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone/preview-iphone-os/">3.0 iPhone software</a> update. A lot of interesting updates were announced, at a pretty crucial time (read: Palm Pre's recent release). Although the updates won't be available for users for a few months, developers will be able to start developing new apps before the mass-release. Below are some basic pro's and con's for me -</p>
<p>PROS: 1. New batch of apps from app developers</p>
<p>2. copy + paste: Finally, this has been a long time coming. I have tried some of the third-party apps but they have been nothing much to speak of.</p>
<p>3. MMS: this will be a nice addition, although I don't find myself sending too many media messages via text. I've been happy using the email functionality or posting media on the web.</p>
<p>4. SMS forwarding: again, nice addition, but haven't really found a need for it in the past. Maybe if it's available I'll make use of it.</p>
<p>5. Multiple photos in 1 E-mail message: this is something that I have found the need for in the past. Looking forward to having this feature to use.</p>
<p>6. Spotlight feature on home page: I have about 5 pages of apps, so this will come in handy, although like most iPhone users there are a handful that I use most often.</p>
<p>CONS: 1. The most glaring con is definitely that there is still no-flash available for the iPhone. Hope this get's changed soon.</p>
<p>2. I can see a hardware change coming soon, which means I will probably want to buy the new device. Which means I will need money.</p>
<p>Looking forward to upgrading and playing around with the new software.</p>
