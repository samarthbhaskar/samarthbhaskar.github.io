<p>Cornel West has come out recently against President Obama, calling him out on his pro-corporate behavior and overall disappointment as POTUS. In <a href="http://www.truthdig.com/report/print/the_obama_deception_why_cornel_west_went_ballistic_20110516/">this interview</a> with Chris Hedges he has two main grievances with Obama, personal and political/ideological. Basically, West feels slighted by Obama for his inattention during the 2008 campaign and (more importantly) disappointed that Obama hasn't reigned in the influence of banks, corporations and the like on government over the course of his time in office.</p>
<p>Not merely a knee jerk reaction, but this just seems petty to me. Melissa Harris-Perry has some thoughts <a href="http://www.thenation.com/blog/160725/cornel-west-v-barack-obama">here</a> that I think may be important to consider (although this piece is somewhat petty in itself). My initial reaction to West's words earlier today was "ugh" and I stand by it.</p>
