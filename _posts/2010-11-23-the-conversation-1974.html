<p>Ain't It Cool News announced <a href="http://http://www.aintitcool.com/node/47547">a competition</a> today for 10 spots to see a special screening ofÂ Darren Aronofsky's <a href="http://http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0947798/">Black Swan</a> in Chicago on Monday. One of the stipulations of the competition was to include a short blurb on what your favorite movie about madness is and why. Below is what I sent in regarding The Conversation, a 1974 film starring Gene Hackman and directed by Francis Ford Coppola.</p>
<blockquote><p>Coppola's directing, the haunting score and Hackman's lifetime performance all really made for a terrific film. Hackman's character is a microcosm for 20th century America for me, his attention is so focused on being the best, that he doesn't realize how much he's screwing up in other facets of his life. I also think there is a lot going on in the character that speaks to every-day madness. The kind of madness that builds on itself and never goes over the edge to truly raise suspicion, but for the person experiencing it, it can almost ruin daily life. That's the kind of madness the majority of people deal with, the kind of that doesn't turn violent but still eats away at the hope of a "normal" life.</p></blockquote>
<p>Hope I get to see the screening on Monday!</p>
