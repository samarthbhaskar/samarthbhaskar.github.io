<p>Drew Conway (hacker, data-scientist, political-scientist, and pseudo-data-celebrity) gave this great talk recently at a conference that I enjoyed. He talks about the intersection of the data-sciences (hacking + statistics) and the social sciences. Drew, whose book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Machine-Learning-Hackers-Drew-Conway/dp/1449303714">Machine Learning for Hackers</a>, I enjoyed a lot is a great example of someone who is bringing the tools of computer science and data-science to bear on an unrelated (at first glance) field, the social sciences.</p>
