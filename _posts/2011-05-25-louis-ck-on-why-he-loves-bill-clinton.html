<p>In this <a href="http://www.esquire.com/features/man-at-his-best/q-and-a/louis-ck-interview-0611">interview with Louis CK</a>, he mentions, among many other gems, why he and Chris Rock love Bill Clinton -</p>
<blockquote><p>Me and Chris try to study a lot of different kinds of people, not just comedians. We both love Bill Clinton — Clinton is America's headliner. One of the greatest things I ever saw was him at Coretta Scott King's funeral. Jimmy Carter, George Bush Senior, Hillary — all these people making speeches, and then Bill Clinton goes on and he says, "Let's all remember that that is a <em>woman</em> lying right there." And he points at her.</p>
<p>It was audacious. "That is a woman who had her dreams and her pain and her passions," and I think he said "lust." He said really personal shit about her and you immediately heard the black people go, "Yes!"</p>
<p>He says, "There's her <em>family</em> — think about what they're going through today, and everything that's happened to them since their daddy got shot. The burden that must have been hers."</p>
<p>Holy shit. I hope to have <em>any</em> of that skill as a comic. He just found this short circuit. You try to have this nature the way water does — finds the lowest place and spreads the fuck out. That's what he did.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is of course not the first time I've heard someone say such things about Clinton, but it may be the first time I've heard a comedian say them.</p>
