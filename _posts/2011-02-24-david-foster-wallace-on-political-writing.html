<blockquote><strong>DFW:</strong> The reason why doing political writing is so hard  right now is probably also the reason why more young (am I included in  the range of this predicate anymore?) fiction writers ought to be doing  it. As of 2003, the rhetoric of the enterprise is fucked. 95 percent of  political commentary, whether spoken or written, is now polluted by the  very politics it’s supposed to be about. Meaning it’s become totally  ideological and reductive: The writer/speaker has certain political  convictions or affiliations, and proceeds to filter all reality and spin  all assertion according to those convictions and loyalties.</p></blockquote>
