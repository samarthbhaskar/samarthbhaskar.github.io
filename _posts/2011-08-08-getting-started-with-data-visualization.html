<p>Having spent the last year working a lot more with data than ever before, I have a new-found appreciation for skillful data visualizations. I have begun to explore some of the more elaboriate visualizations that are possibile with R, Excel and Processing, but I certainly have a long ways to go. Here's a good blog post from Enrico Bertini over at <a href="http://fellinlovewithdata.com/">Fell In Love With Data</a>Â about how to get started with data visualization.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="http://fellinlovewithdata.com/guides/how-to-become-a-data-visualization-expert-a-recipe">How to Become a Data Visualization Expert: A Recipe</a></p>
<p>1) Study a Lot<br />
2) Steal<br />
3) Criticize<br />
4) Produce<br />
5) Seek Discomfort</p></blockquote>
<p>I'm hoping to bring these skills to bear on future research and job opportunities, so I can advance not only my ability to draw inferences on data (social, political, or otherwise) but also present the data and my inferences more skillfully.</p>
