<p>Just a quick post after my first full day in Dubai -</p>
<p>Last night I stayed the night at my friend Eeshaan's house. He was a huge help yesterday and today so a big thanks to Eeshaan and the Roy family! I tried my best to fall asleep but after sleeping 10 out of the 12 hours on the flight, I wasn't exactly ready to sleep again right away. So the goal of eliminating any and all jet-lag wasn't accomplished but I'm hoping today's full day of running around and not sleeping a wink will help put me on track starting tomorrow.</p>
<p>I moved in to my dorm room today. It is much bigger than even the triple I lived in my freshman year at UIUC (although not nearly as awesome due to a lack of great roommates like Ty and G). I have a bed, desk, big closet and a bathroom. My roommate seems like a great guy. He's from Tehran and we've already talked a few times about Iran/US relations (more on that later...). He's into cinema and movies so we definitely have that in common.</p>
<p>I got a phone today and will shortly be activating a Skype number so I'll be pretty readily available to those in the U.S. and elsewhere. My number here is +971503982969.</p>
<p>I have been driving around Dubai quite a bit and am absolutely amazed at the grandeur of the city. It is elaborate in every sense. I can't quite do justice to all my first impressions just yet (mostly because its late and I'm tired) but I definitely plan on posting some of reactions to seeing the huge buildings, extensive infrastructure, sprawling shopping centers and malls, et al. Suffice it to say for now, every time I drive by the Burj Khalifa I can't believe my eyes and still think it looks computer generated even in reality.</p>
<p>Time to get some rest for now and hopefully spend more time exploring the city tomorrow. I'll try and write a succinct and annotated update about my first few days later on this weekend.</p>
<p>Thanks to all who have been posting, commenting and asking about my time here. Its always great to be reminded of how many people care about me.</p>
