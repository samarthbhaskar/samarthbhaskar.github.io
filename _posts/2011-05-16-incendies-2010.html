<p>Over the weekend I watched <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1255953/"><em>Incendies</em> (2010)</a>, a French-Canadian film based on a play about a pair of siblings who are hurled down a journey down their mother's past in Lebanon, to answer some very important questions. The film is set up right away with an obvious <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacGuffin">MacGuffin</a> regarding an unknown father and brother, and it follows this quest along a path of historical events centered on the Lebanese Civil War. The film is enhanced by a knowledge of the basics of the Lebanese Civil War, but can certainly be understood without.</p>
<p>I really enjoyed the film and recommend it highly. It is certainly not for the faint of heart, but the story is masterfully crafted and the film is beautifully put together. Trailer <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1255953/videogallery">here</a>. Reviews <a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/incendies/">here</a>.</p>
