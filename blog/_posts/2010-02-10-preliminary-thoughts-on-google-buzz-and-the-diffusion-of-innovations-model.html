<p>After a while of just posting about Dubai, I thought I’d comment on something of interest other than my recent travels in the Middle East. With the new launch of <a href="google.com/buzz">Google Buzz</a>, I thought this would be a good time to blog about social media. In specific I’d like to outline a new model I learned about and using the example of Google Buzz I’d like to comment on the diffusion of new media technologies.</p>
<p>The diffusion of innovations model tries to outline and understand how new innovations permeate society and become efficacious tools for people to use. Although its origins stem from health promotion I think it can readily be applied to new technology and society, including new media technologies.</p>
<p>The three main components of this model are as follows (in parenthesis will be how I believe these models apply, at first glance, to something like Google Buzz)</p>
<p><strong>1. Characteristics of the innovation</strong></p>
<p>a. Relative advantage (I think the fact that Buzz uses a highly utilized platform such as Gmail as its base provides an advantage)</p>
<p>b. Compatibility (Google users are usually interested in aggregating their internet use, heck there’s even a complete OS being developed for Google users)</p>
<p>c. Complexity (this seems to be a bit of a contentious point so far, although I think with feedback and some time, people will be able to use Buzz seamlessly)</p>
<p>d. Triability (I think some early Twitter users fall off the board when they fail to realize its utility as a micro-blogging tool, rather than a life-caster, which could be something Buzz users might fall prey to)</p>
<p><strong>2. The Diffusion Process</strong> (this is referring to the actual launch and dissemination of Buzz)</p>
<p><strong>3. The adopters</strong></p>
<p>a. Innovators (Google developers, people with high ranking Google accounts and relationships)</p>
<p>b. Early adopters (Google users with wide-spread and meaningful social relationships online, who use Buzz effectively)</p>
<p>c. Early majority adopters (moving more towards lighter users but still those with some social capitol to capitalize)</p>
<p>d. Late majority adopters (still moving down the line of user status, but still among those who are somewhat engaged)</p>
<p>e. Laggards (people who will not use Buzz at all, or expend any social capitol to let Buzz take off)</p>
<p>Overall, I think Buzz is a worthwhile operation for Google. I know I myself, and my close friends have tried to find a way to share content in the most meaningful yet most comfortable way. So far it has been restrictive, whether through StumbleUpon, Facebook, Twitter, Google Reader or Google-Wave or Gmail conversations. Perhaps Google Buzz will strike that golden balance and have a seamless transition into my internet usage habits. For now, I look forward to <a href="http://www.google.com/profiles/samarth.bhaskar">entrusting more of my life</a> in Google’s hands.</p>
