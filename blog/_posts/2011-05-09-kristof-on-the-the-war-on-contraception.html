<p>Nick <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/08/opinion/08kristof.html?_r=2&amp;src=tptw">Kristof wrote in the NYT</a> on mothers' day about the Republican war on contraception, as it extends past just the domestic context. Its a good reminder, for those who need reminding.</p>
<p>I'm not sure about this claim here, seems dubious to me, but that's just a gut reaction for now -</p>
<blockquote><p>Yet maybe the simplest way to save her life would have been contraception. If Somali women had half as many pregnancies (they now average six births), there would be only half as many maternal deaths. But modern contraception doesnâ€™t exist in this part of Somaliland.</p></blockquote>
