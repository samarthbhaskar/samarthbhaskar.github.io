<p>Wesley Yang has a <a href="http://nymag.com/news/features/asian-americans-2011-5/">long-form piece</a> in the NY Mag that cuts and weaves its away across some pretty important issues of gender, power, social-mobility and self-actualization as they manifest themselves for many Asian-Americans. Originally, I thought this piece was kind of a re-hashing of old issues, but after talking to some people and thinking more about it, I think it addresses some concerns that a lot of people don't afford themselves the opportunity to address. Although it winds up talking about the over-discussed <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704111504576059713528698754.html">Amy Chua</a> controvery, I think its worth the read.</p>
<p>A short excerpt that I liked, maybe because I feel like I'm in this place in my life now -</p>
<blockquote><p>Throughout my twenties, I proudly turned away from one institution of American life after another (for instance, a steady job), though they had already long since turned away from me. Academe seemed another kind of death—but then again, I had a transcript marred by as many F’s as A’s. I had come from a culture that was the middle path incarnate. And yet for some people, there can be no middle path, only transcendence or descent into the abyss.</p>
<p>I was descending into the abyss.</p></blockquote>
