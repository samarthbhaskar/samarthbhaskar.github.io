<p>On October 16, 2013 I participated in an Ignite event at Etsy. 12 of my colleagues and I got 5 minutes, 20 auto-advancing slides and the attention of a room-full of our friends and colleagues to tell a story. I talked about why I think it's important to spend time getting outside of your domain of expertise and learning new things, from the arts for example.</p>
<p>I really enjoyed putting words and order to my thoughts on this subject. If you've followed my Twitter feed at any point in time, you can tell me affinity for all different domains of knowledge. Here's to more years of consumption, production, exploration and expansion.</p>
