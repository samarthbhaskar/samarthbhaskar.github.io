<blockquote><em>“All the lives we could live, all the people we will never know, never will be, they are everywhere. That is what the world is.”  -- Aleksandar Hemon, The Lazarus Project</em></p></blockquote>
<p>A while ago I read an essay by one of my favorite pseudo mainstream neuroscience researchers, <a href="http://www.jonahlehrer.com/">Jonah Lehrer</a> called “<a href="http://scienceblogs.com/cortex/2009/12/why_we_travel.php">Why We Travel</a>.” It put into a neurological perspective something I have felt for a long time. I have always had a particular penchant for travelling. As soon as I got my license as a 16 year old, I was always suggesting and trying to set up road trips. I spent a great deal of time in college travelling around the country with my <a href="http://chaitown.org/">a cappella</a> group. Although travelling clearly has a very basic level of enjoyment attached to it, I have always felt like there’s something more that makes it so attractive.</p>
<p>Lehrer, in “Why We Travel<em>,”</em> makes a convincing argument that travel is a natural human desire. He says that we travel because we need to, because it fulfills a natural desire in our minds. His closing line is powerful, for me – “When we get home, home is still the same. But something in our mind has been changed, and that changes everything.”</p>
<p>The first time I travelled under my own auspices was when I came back from India after attending a cousin’s wedding in the winter of 2004. I spent a 5 hour layover in Paris Charles De Gaulle (one of the <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2009/TRAVEL/01/12/worst.airports/index.html">worst airports</a> in the world, by the way), and started to appreciate time spent people-watching, strolling around, thinking and feeling unnoticed. One of my favorite parts about spending time in airports is the thought that no one is interested in who I am, what I’m doing or where I’m going. Although I’m not one to shy away from the responsibility that is associated with being a member of a community (communities like my home, school, friends, etc.) it is nice to take a break from it and enjoy a certain level of anonymity.</p>
<p>I have already spent more than 12 hours in transit since I left home this morning, and I still haven’t left the country. I’m sure many people would find this a cumbersome and frustrating experience but I revel in it. I always look forward to travelling, especially by myself, so much so that I dress up for it, ha. I enjoy grabbing a few books, having my laptop and phone with  me, walking around terminals, planning how I’m going to maneuver the security line (especially the moment where it goes from dormant-standing-in-line to a mad dash where you feel like you’re doing everything wrong under the watchful eye of big-TSA-brother).</p>
<p>As the quote above captures very well and as Lehrer explains, I think travelling/migration/emigration all capture a certain level of humanity (heck, its even part of the <a href="http://www.hrweb.org/legal/undocs.html">UN Agreements on Human Right</a>s). Nothing is as humbling and grounding as the understanding that you are one small part of a larger reality.</p>
