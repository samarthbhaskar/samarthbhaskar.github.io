<p>I just finished reading <em>Dead Aid: Why Aid is not Working and How There is a Better Way for Africa</em> by <a href="http://www.dambisamoyo.com/">Dambisa Moyo</a>. I also <a href="http://www.theworld.org/?q=taxonomy_by_date/1/20090325">caught</a> her on <a href="http://www.theworld.org/">The World</a> by Public Radio International on the way home this afternoon. After reading a little more about her, I can say I'm truly impressed. Just to name a few of her accomplishments, Moyo has worked for Goldman Sachs, the World Bank and is on the board of <a href="http://www.jbs.cam.ac.uk/research/centres/cibam/">Cambridge University's Centre for International Business and Management (CIBAM)</a>. She has taken macroeconomic issues and applied them to her homeland of Zambia and Africa in a very innovative way.</p>
<p>Below are some highlights from her book and radio interview:</p>
<p>1. Aid is not helping Africa: Her take-home argument is that the $1 trillion dollars in aid that African nations have received in the last 50 years (really puts the <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Business/Economy/story?id=6022145&amp;page=1">$3 trillion dollar bailout</a> in perspective) has actually hurt African nations more than it has helped them. "Moyo illuminates the way in which overreliance on aid has trapped developing nations in a vicious circle of aid dependency, corruption, market distortion, and further poverty, leaving them with nothing but the “need” for more aid."</p>
<p>2. Why must Africa develop differently than other nations?: Moyo asks why African nations must depend on foreign aid for development instead of following similar paths such as South, Southeast and East-Asian nations. One of her conclusions about foreign aid to African nations is that it is deeply rooted in a sense of pity for the African people. I wonder if there is some post-colonial analysis at work here, or if this alleged pity is just another sense of colonialism through rhetoric and pop-culture instead of militarism and exploitation of resources.</p>
<p>Ultimately, Moyo calls for a hault to aid to increase economic growth in Africa. Although her call for a complete hault to aid (except humanitarian and emergency relief aid) is a bit much, I do agree that there needs to be a major recapitualation of how aid is delivered and used by African nations. This recapitualiation, in my opinion, needs to happen on both the side of the donors and on receivers.</p>
<p>What're your thoughts? In a global economic crisis, are you among those who think stopping aid is beneficial for all, or those who believe a time like this is as crucial as any to continue aid?</p>
