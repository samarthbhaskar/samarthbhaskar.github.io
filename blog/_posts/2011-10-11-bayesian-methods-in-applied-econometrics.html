<p>Christopher Simms, of recent <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-10-10/sargent-sims-share-2011-nobel-in-economics.html">Nobel fame</a>, has a<a href="http://sims.princeton.edu/yftp/EmetSoc607/AppliedBayes.pdf"> presentation</a> [pdf] up on his website from 2007 that is a pretty good introduction to the difference between frequentist and Bayesian approaches to economics, and ultimately why a Bayesian approach is most prudent for economists.</p>
<p>This from his introduction sets up the basic premises of his presentation -</p>
<blockquote><p>Introduction</p>
<ul>
<li>The ﬁrst part of the talk makes some unoriginal claims about the role of Bayesian thinking.</li>
<li>Despite being unoriginal, and obvious to me and to a minority of econometricians, they are unfamiliar, thought-provoking, or outrageous to quite a few econometricians.</li>
<li>A summer seminar talk seems a good place to restate claims that are both obvious and outrageous and that therefore (for one of these reasons or the other) are usually excluded from journal articles.</li>
<li>The latter part of the talk discusses some areas of econometric application where frequentist asymptotics seems particularly persistent and suggests how Bayesian approaches might become more practical and prevalent.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<div>Although I'm not entirely comfortable with Bayesian statistics, this was an interesting presentation to read none the less. I plan on referring back to this in the future when I come across some decisions about methodology for research projects.</div>
